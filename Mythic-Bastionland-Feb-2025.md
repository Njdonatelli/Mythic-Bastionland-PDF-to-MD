## Beginnings & Glory

**GETTING STARTED**

One player is the Referee. They should read through to the end of the rules section [\(p21\)](#page-20-0). The other players can go straight to the Knighthood page opposite and need not read any further unless curious.

## **START & SCOPE**

Every group that sits down to play the game is different, and you should consider the Start and Scope of a game before you begin.

The **Start** is the opening situation that the players find themselves in. The **Scope** is how long you expect the game to run, both in and out of game.

## **START**

**Wanderer -** Young Knights-Errant with d6GD (Guard) and d12+d6 in each Virtue. They arrive in the Realm seeking Glory. If they lack direction, have them seek a Seer's counsel.

**Courtier** - Mature Knights-Gallant with 2d6GD and d12+6 (six, not d6) in each Virtue. They have a place in Court at the Seat of Power. The first Omen of the nearest Myth is delivered as news to the Court.

**Ruler** - Mature Knights-Tenant with d6+6GD and d12+6 (six, not d6) in each Virtue. One Knight rules a Holding, the others are in their Circle. The Seat of Power is under a wicked influence.

## **SCOPES**

**Adventure** - One session. Here it can save time to generate a few Knights ahead of the game and let the players choose one each.

**Chronicle** - A known number of sessions. Season and Age turns are planned out ahead of time. For six sessions this might be a Season turn at the end of each session, and an Age turn at the end of each Winter.

**Saga** - An indeterminate number of sessions. Here you can let the players guide the scope as they explore the world.

**GLORY**

All Knights seek Glory, that they might one day be deemed worthy of the City Quest.

## **GLORY THROUGH MYTHS**

When the group feels that a Myth has been resolved, reaching a conclusion of any type, all Knights who played a part in that Myth gain **1 Glory**.

## **GLORY BY OTHER MEANS**

In a public duel or joust, Knights may stake Glory against a willing opponent. The victor gains 1 Glory, the loser loses 1 Glory.

Tournaments may also grant 1 Glory to the winning Knight, provided there are significant spectators and spectacle.

If a battle is large enough to be remembered in history, all Knights on the victorious side gain 1 Glory.

When the game moves to a new Age all Knights gain 1 Glory through serving the Realm and manoeuvring in Court.

## **RANK**

A Knight's Glory dictates their rank:

**0 Glory - Knight-Errant** Worthy of leading a Warband

**3 Glory - Knight-Gallant** Worthy of a seat in Council or Court

**6 Glory - Knight-Tenant** Worthy of ruling a Holding

**9 Glory - Knight-Dominant** Worthy of ruling a Seat of Power

**12 Glory - Knight-Radiant** Worthy of the City Quest

## **WORTHINESS**

Rank alone does not immediately grant the Knight a Council position or rule of a Holding. It merely proves their worthiness.

A Knight may find themselves in a position for which their rank is unworthy. They are sure to face initial opposition, but if this can be overcome then their worthiness is proven.

## Knighthood

You are Knights, united by a common Oath and visions of the City. You may have dreams of glory, but every Knight must accept the risk of death.

The Seers who knighted you have deemed that you travel as a **Company**. While some of you may rest, roam, or die, your collective journey will be as one.

Knights have 3 **Virtues**. Roll a value for each in order. The **Start** that you chose for your Company determines the dice you roll. If unsure, roll d12+d6.

## VIGOUR

Strong limbs, firm hands, powerful lungs.

## CLARITY

Keen instinct, lucid mind, shrewd eyes.

## SPIRIT

Charming tongue, iron will, fierce heart.

Roll for **Guard** (GD), your skill at avoiding Wounds. The Start that you chose for your company determines the dice you roll.

Roll or choose a **Knight** (p26).

This gives:

Property: Items brought with you.

**Ability:** A special talent unique to you.

**Passion:** A special means you have to restore your Spirit.

Every Knight has a dagger (d6), torches, rope, dry rations, and camping gear.

Every Knight knows the three Feats (p10).

Every Knight has sworn the Oath:

SEEK THE MYTHS
HONOUR THE SEERS
PROTECT THE REALM

**SQUIRES** 

Small Companies (2 Knights or fewer) may give each Knight a Squire. They serve as apprentices, and are not yet Knights, so cannot gain Glory or perform Feats.

2d6 for each Virtue, 1GD.

They ride a pony (VIG 7, CLA 7, SPI 2, 2GD) and carry a dagger (d6).

Roll d6 for their extra equipment.

1: Cudgel (d8 hefty), 2: Axe (d8 hefty),

3: Hatchet (d6), 4: Shortbow (d6 long),

**5:** Shield (d4, A1), **6:** Three Javelins (d6).

When Knighted they gain d6 in each Virtue.

## Basic Rules

## **SAVES**

To pass a Save, roll a d20 equal or below the relevant Virtue. Failure means negative consequences, not always a failed action.

## **VIRTUES**

Virtues can be reduced and raised in a number of ways, but can never go higher than 19 or lower than 0.

## **TURNS**

A turn is enough time to Move and then perform an Action, always in that order.

## **SURPRISE**

Players normally take the first turn of combat, discussing their plan and acting in any order they wish.

Characters who were not readied for combat must pass a CLA Save or miss the first turn.

## **REACTION**

Non-player characters react in a way that feels appropriate for the current context.

When uncertain, a character makes a SPI Save to avoid an unfavourable reaction.

## **EXPOSED**

Characters who are caught with their guard down or otherwise defenceless are *Exposed* and act as if they have 0GD. If they remedy their situation then they are no longer *Exposed*. Traps and ambushes typically catch victims *Exposed*.

## **FEATS**

These special actions known by Knights can be performed as described. Using Feats risks the Knight becoming *Fatigued* which prevents them from using further Feats until they rest.

## **DEATH**

Even the boldest Knight can die a sudden or ignoble death. Prepare yourself for this.

When a Knight dies the player creates a new Knight and they are added to the Company as quickly as possible. Alternatively they may assume control of a Squire or follower.

## **ATTACKS**

Take the Attack dice noted on your weapon(s), shield, and granted by bonuses.

Go through the following steps in order:

- 1. All combatants attacking the same target roll their dice at the same time.
- 2. If the target or their nearby allies can *Deny* [\(p10\)](#page-9-0) they may use it.
- 3. Attackers may perform Gambits([p10\)](#page-9-0).
- 4. Take the highest die remaining.
- 5. Add any extra Damage from attackers who are *Bolstering* the Attack [\(p10](#page-9-0)).
- 6. Subtract the target's total Armour score.
- 7. The Attack causes that much Damage.

So a Knight with a mace (d8) and shield (d4) is aided by an ally with 2 daggers (d6 each). They roll d8 and d4, and 2d6 respectively.

The dice show 7, 3, 1, and 5. The highest die is 7. The 5 is spent on a Gambit to *Bolster* the Damage to 8. The target has Armour 2 (helm and shield), reducing the Damage to 6.

**Impaired** attacks roll d4 only and cannot gain bonus dice or benefit from Feats.

**Blast** attacks target everybody in their area, rolling each separately.

## **DAMAGE**

The attack's Damage is deducted from the target's GD.

If they have at least 1GD remaining then they Evade the Attack.

If it leaves them with exactly 0GD then they gain a Scar.

If it exceeds the target's GD, the excess is deducted from VIG and they are Wounded.

If they lose half or more of their remaining VIG it is a Mortal Wound. Mortally Wounded targets are down and dying. They die if left untended for an hour, but can be patched up in a few moments.

If Damage reduces the target's VIG to 0, they are Slain.

## Harm & Scars

## **VIRTUE LOSS**

Virtues may be reduced by means other than Damage, typically referred to as Virtue Loss. In addition to the situations listed in the rules, characters may suffer Virtue Loss as the cost or consequence of an action. This is detailed in the Action Procedure([p16](#page-15-0)).

Victims are only Slain or Mortally Wounded if the Virtue was reduced by Damage, never as a result of Virtue Loss.

At VIG 0 you are *Exhausted* and cannot Attack if you have moved this turn.

At CLA 0 you are *Exposed* and treated as having 0GD.

At SPI 0 your attacks are *Impaired* rolling a single d4 only.

## **RECOVERY**

**Guard** is fully restored with just a moment of peace after the danger has passed. **Fatigue** is also removed this way.

**Virtues** can be fully restored by 3 means:

- Consuming a specific type of **Remedy**
- Performing a specific **Action**
- Skipping to a new **Season**

**Vigour** is restored by consuming Sustenance or spending a full day in warm hospitality.

**Clarity** is restored by consuming Stimulant or receiving guidance from a Seer.

**Spirit** is restored by consuming Sacrament or indulging a Passion.

## **REMEDIES**

A single Remedy is a sizeable bundle of materials and tools. A person or dedicated beast of burden can only carry one at once.

Using a Remedy requires a whole Phase of the day, and is more about the ceremonial act than the material components themselves.

The Virtue is restored before resolving any Omens or other encounters. A single Remedy is enough to benefit all company present.

## **SCARS**

Take the die that caused the Scar and roll it again, consulting the table below for the specific Scar caused.

Virtue Loss through Scars is not Damage, so cannot Mortally Wound or Slay the victim.

Scars are only gained through real, deadly combat, not training or bloodless duels.

#### **SCAR Distress** – *A lucky escape* Lose d6 SPI. **2 Disfigurement** – *A permanent mark* Roll 1d6: 1: Eye, 2: Cheek, 3: Neck, 4: Torso, 5: Nose, 6: Jaw. If your max GD is 2 or less, increase it by d6. **3 Smash** – *A sudden spray of blood* Lose d6 VIG. **4 Stun** – *Pain drowns the senses* Lose d6 CLA If your max GD is 4 or less, increase it by d6. **5 Rupture** – *Innards pierced and compressed* Lose 2d6 VIG. **6 Gouge** – *Flesh torn from bone* When you get stitched up, if your max GD is 6 or less, increase it by d6. **7 Concussion** – *A heavy blow numbs the mind* Lose 2d6 CLA. **8 Tear** – *Something taken in violent struggle* Roll 1d6: 1: Nose, 2: Ear, 3: Finger, 4: Thumb, 5: Eye, 6: Chunk of Scalp. When you get patched up, if your max GD is 8 or less, increase it by d6 **9 Agony** – *With a crack, a torturous break* Lose 2d6 SPI.

**Mutilation** – *A limb rendered lost or useless* Roll 1d6:

**10** 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Shield Arm, 5-6: Sword Arm. By next Season you have a prosthetic or have learned to get by, and if your max GD is 10 or less, increase it by d6.

**Doom** – *A cheated death haunts you* If you take a Mortal Wound this Season you are Slain instead.

**11**

**12**

**Humiliation** – *A most dolorous stroke* When you achieve revenge, if your max GD is 12 or less, increase it by d6.

## <span id="page-9-0"></span>Specifics of Combat

## **FEATS**

After using a Feat the user must pass a Save or become *Fatigued*, unable to perform Feats until they rest. Each Feat can only be used once per Attack by each combatant involved.

## SMITE - Release your righteous fury

- · Use before rolling a melee Attack.
- The Attack gains either +d12 or Blast.
- Pass a VIG Save or become *Fatigued*.

## **FOCUS** - Create an opening to exploit

- · Use after rolling an Attack.
- · Perform a Gambit without using a die.
- · Pass a CLA Save or become Fatigued.

## **DENY** - Rebuff an attack before it lands

- Use after an Attack roll against you or an ally within arm's reach.
- · Discard one Attack die.
- · Pass a SPI Save or become Fatigued.

#### **GAMBITS**

Attackers may discard any number of Attack dice of 4 or higher to perform Gambits, each causing one of the effects below. The affected foe must be a target of the original attack.

For Gambits other than *Bolster* and *Move* the target receives a VIG Save to ignore the effect.

- Bolster the Attack for +1 total Damage
- Move after the Attack, even if you already moved or are unable to move
- · Repel a foe away from you
- **Stop** a foe from moving next turn
- **Impair** a weapon on their next turn
- Trap a shield until your next turn
- Dismount a foe
- Other effect of a similar level of impact

If a die of 8 or higher is used in melee then a **Strong Gambit** is performed and the attacker chooses **one** of the following:

- No Save is granted to the target
- Greater effect such as disarming an item, breaking a wooden shield or weapon, or removing a helm. This does not increase the Damage from *Bolster*.

### MINOR ACTIONS

Changing weapons, dismounting, and similar actions do not count as a combatant's action for the turn.

## BONUS ATTACK DICE

These are gained from useful information, shrewd preparations, or a tactical advantage. +d8 is a typical bonus.

#### **UNARMED COMBAT**

Unarmed attacks are *Impaired* unless the attacker has suitable natural weapons.

#### RANGED COMBAT

Purely ranged weapons cannot be used if the attacker began their turn engaged in melee.

Protective cover grants an additional point of Armour against ranged attacks.

#### MOUNTED COMBAT

Mounted combatants use their steed's trample Damage in addition to their own weapons when charging enemies on foot. This doesn't work against spearwalls. Steeds can be targeted separately by attacks.

Being dismounted causes d6 Damage.

## **DUELS & JOUSTS**

Two combatants can mutually agree to engage in a duel, or joust if mounted.

They fight as normal but their attacks are rolled and resolved simultaneously, including the effects of Gambits. Both combatants can use Feats before the attacks are resolved.

### SHIELDWALLS & SPEARWALLS

3 or more allies may form a wall formation. If they all bear shields (not bucklers) then they gain an additional point of Armour. If they all bear spears (or similar) then enemies cannot Attack on the turn that they charge.

## WAVERING MORALE

Individuals who are Wounded, or groups who lose half their number, must pass a SPI Save to avoid rout or surrender.

Organised groups roll once using their leader's SPI. Disorganised groups roll for each individual against their own SPI.

This does not affect player characters.

![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

## **WARBANDS**

Two-dozen or so combatants fighting together are treated as a single Warband.

- When they are Mortally Wounded they are routed from the battle.
- At VIG 0 they are wiped out entirely, at SPI 0 they are broken.
- They are not harmed by individual attacks unless they are Blast attacks or suitably large-scale.
- Warband attacks against individuals receive +d12 and cause Blast Damage.

## **LEADING FROM THE FRONT**

One individual within a Warband can add their Attack dice to the Warband's Attack Roll, leading from the front. If they do, they suffer the same Damage that the Warband does until their next turn.

## **WOOD AND STONE**

Ships and structures are destroyed at 0GD. Recovering GD takes a day of repairs.

Wooden structures and ships ignore Attacks other than from fire, siege weapons, or suitably large creatures.

Stone walls cannot be breached by conventional means, though their gates are usually a viable target.

Gate: 5GD, A2 Rampart: 10GD, A2 Castle Wall: 10GD, A3

Colliding ships take d12 Damage. If one ship is much larger it takes d6 Damage instead.

Rowboat: 4GD, carries 6 passengers Longship: 7GD, A1, carries a Warband Warship: 10GD, A2, carries 2 Warbands

## **ARTILLERY AND SIEGERY**

Siege Tower: 7GD, A2 Battering Ram: d12 Stone Thrower: d12 blast Bolt Launcher: 2d12

Trebuchet: 3d12 blast, immobile

## **RECRUITMENT**

Soldiers are drawn from loyal Vassals, Knights that share a cause, or mercenaries who have agreed a price.

Whatever their origin, soldiers expect their basic needs to be met during their service.

Warbands who are ill-rested, poorly fed, or otherwise pushed too far typically lose SPI. At SPI 0 a Warband will not follow orders, acting only in their self interest.

## **WARBANDS**

Militia: VIG 10, CLA 10, SPI 7, 3GD Crude polearm (d8 long)

Skirmishers: VIG 10, CLA 13, SPI 10, 2GD Shortbow (d6 long)

Mercenaries: VIG 13, CLA 10, SPI 10, 4GD A3 (mail, helm, shield) Spear (d8 hefty), shield (d4)

Riders: VIG 10, CLA 13, SPI 10, 3GD Javelins (d6), handaxe (d6), steed

Knights: VIG 13, CLA 10, SPI 13, 5GD A3 (mail, helm, shield) Mace (d8 hefty), shield (d4), charger (d8 trample)

### TRADE

Only the rich deal in coins. Most trade is an exchange of raw materials, goods, or service. Frequent trades often grow into ongoing pledges of service, cooperation, or protection.

Simply, if you hope to trade you should have a good answer to the question "What can I offer that they would value?".

Common items are widely available. Uncommon items require a specialist. Rare items are truly treasured.

#### WIELDING WEAPONS

If no type is noted, assume the weapon uses one hand and has no other restrictions.

**Hefty** weapons require one hand. Only one Hefty item can be wielded at once. **Long** weapons require both hands and are

Impaired in confined environments.

Slow weapons cannot be used if the attacker has moved this turn. They are also Long.

## **COMMON WEAPONS**

Hefty Tools: d6 hefty (pitchfork, hatchet) Long Tools: d8 long (staff, logging axe, pick)

Hand Weapons: d6 (dagger, club, handaxe) Hefty Weapons: d8 hefty (spear, mace, axe) Long Weapons: d10 long (poleaxe, billhook)

Sling: d4 hefty Javelin: d6 hefty Shortbow: d6 long

#### UNCOMMON WEAPONS

Shortsword: 2d6

Lance: d10 long, count as hefty if mounted Brutal Weapons: 2d10 slow (greataxe, maul)

Longbow: d8 slow

#### RARE WEAPONS

Longsword: 2d8 hefty Greatsword: 2d10 long

Curvebow: 2d6 long Crossbow: 2d8 slow

#### SPECIALIST WEAPONS

Take an existing common or uncommon weapon with +d8 or +d10 in a specific situation. Make it one category rarer.

#### WEARING ARMOUR

One of each armour type (coat, plates, helm, shield) can be worn at once, combining their armour scores together. Plates and helm are generally not worn outside of battle.

#### **COMMON ARMOUR**

Shield: d4, A1 (round, kite, heater)

## **UNCOMMON ARMOUR**

Coat: A1 (mail, gambeson, flexible armour suitable for general wear or beneath plates)

Helm: A1 (kettle, nasal, bucket, coif)

#### RARE ARMOUR

#### TOOLS

Common Tools: Saw, fishing rod, sewing set, candles, shovel, flute
Uncommon Tools: Animal trap, smithing tools, herbalist kit, scribe set, lute

Common: Sickness and discomfort Uncommon: Suffering, then slow death Rare: Death plus speed, secrecy, or suffering

## People & Realms

**SERVICE** 

Holdings house a range of people who can be called on for service. The larger the Holding, the more likely that a particular service is being offered there.

Many will gladly offer their service to a Knight, but all have limits, after which they ask something in return or refuse entirely.

As with trade, the key question comes down to "What can I offer that they would value?".

Common services are offered everywhere. Uncommon services require training. Rare services require a lifetime dedication.

Roll their Virtues on d12+d6.

## COMMON

Servant: 2gD

Single duty with little expertise

Guide: 4GD

Handaxe (d6), javelin (d6), local knowledge

Sentry: 3gd

Billhook (d10 long), little appetite for combat

#### UNCOMMON

Herbalist: 2gd

Knows treatments, not cures

Soldier-at-Arms: 6GD A2 (helm, shield)

Spear (d6 hefty), shield (d4), battle worn

Archer: 3gp

Shortbow (d6 long)

#### RARE

area of expertise

Alchemist: 2gD

Sellsword: 7gd

A4 (coat, plates, helm, shield) Longsword (2d8 hefty), shield (d4)

Generally only agrees to fights that they are

confident they can win

#### REALMS

- The world is fractured into petty Realms, each ruled from a Seat of Power.
- Smaller Holdings are walled settlements tended by Vassals, guarded by Knights.
- Most that lies between is wilderness.

#### **MYTHS**

- Stories that became truths, or are destined to come to pass.
- Nobody agrees on the details, but every version is true in some way.
- · There's no such thing as "just a myth".

#### ROLES

- Most fall into one of four roles: Vassal, Vagabond, Knight, or Seer. A web of seniority exists within and between each.
- Vassals serve a ruler, typically a Knight, in return for protection.
- Vagabonds roam, working for and protecting only themselves.

#### SEERS

- Those who understand the nature of Myth enough to glimpse into our future.
- Their visions grant legitimacy and direction to a Knight's quest.
- They know when a Squire is ready to become a Knight, and when a Knight is ready to seek the City.

#### KNIGHTS

- Those who take the Oath are held in esteem, but expectations burden them.
- They rely on their arms, but are expected to know the customs of peace.
- Usually one Knight holds each title, passed on in retirement or death.

#### **FAITH**

- Some believe there is truth in the sky: the stars, moon, sun, positions, and motions.
- Some look to nature: the turn of seasons, the sound of trees, the wisdom of beasts.
- Some believe the sacred stories that weave into Myths, guiding us to the City.

## <span id="page-13-0"></span>Creating a Realm

## **BREAKING THE RULES**

The guidelines on this page make for a typical Realm, but they can be bent or broken in creating your own Realms.

## **THE HEX MAP**

A Realm is mapped on a hexagonal grid covering the loose rule of a Seat of Power. A 12x12 grid is typical, whether the Realm is landlocked, coastal, or an island chain.

Typically, players get a copy of the map with Holdings and general terrain marked. They cannot see Myths, Landmarks, and Barriers.

The distance covered by each hexagon is a Hecksleague, commonly called a Hex.

This distance represents a few loose factors:

- The area a hill fort can overlook
- The area that guards can patrol in a day
- A return hike to a neighbouring Hex gets you home before dark

## **WILDERNESS**

Most Hexes are Wilderness, with a variety of terrain types. Spark Tables [\(p22\)](#page-21-0) can help with this. As a general guide create clusters of d12 hexes of the same terrain type.

Some Hexes have a Barrier on one of their edges, typically a sudden altitude change or impassible feature. These cannot normally be travelled through. For a typical Realm, place Barriers one sixth of your total Hexes.

Most Realms have a navigable river passing through and a few large lakes spanning whole or multiple Hexes.

## **HOLDINGS**

Place 4 Holdings a good distance apart, typically castles, walled towns, fortresses, or towers, held by Knights or influential Vassals. Most of the Realm lives within their walls or the surrounding Hex.

Designate one Holding as the Seat of Power. This is the Holding of the ruler of the whole Realm, commonly a Knight.

## **MYTH HEXES**

Place 6 Myths ([p27](#page-26-0)) in remote places. Number them as 1-6. The Hexes are clearly affected by the presence of their Myth.

## **LANDMARKS**

Some Wilderness Hexes contain a Landmark. These are discovered when travellers roll 4-6 on the Wilderness roll. A typical Realm has 3 or 4 of each type of Landmark. Mark them with their initial or an icon.

Even characters who know a Landmark's location must still make a Wilderness Roll to check for Omens as they travel there.

Each Landmark type covers a range of specific features, with prompts provided on Knight and Myth pages later in the book.

The course of the game may create new Landmarks or remove or alter existing ones.

**Dwellings**: Humble homes amid the wilds.

**Sanctums**: Each the sacred home to a Seer. Roll on the Knight table([p26\)](#page-25-0), consulting their page to discover which Seer.

**Monuments**: Sites of inspiration. Travellers may spend a Phase to restore SPI here as if they were consuming a Sacrament.

**Hazards**: Nature fights your every step. Devise a solution, push through (lose d6 VIG), or go back the way you came.

**Curses:** Blights on the land that throw you off course. If you travel in the next Phase it counts as travelling blind([p18](#page-17-0)).

**Ruins**: Remnants of the past echo the future. These hint at a random Myth not currently active in the Realm, though it may return.

## **ADDING DETAILS**

Spark Tables [\(p22\)](#page-21-0) can add detail to significant locations and people in the Realm.

## **DISTANT REALMS**

Realms are usually bordered by water, mountains, or wasteland, though claims are often disputed. Travelling to a distant Realm normally sees you arrive in the next Season.

![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg)

A Knight's journey largely focuses on travelling great distances to seek the guidance of Seers and uncover Myths.

However, on occasion there may be the need to zoom in on a single Hex, or a specific site within a Hex, in more detail.

Sites can be created as areas that warrant more detailed exploration, whether ancient tombs, hostile castles, twisting caverns, or misty woods spanning the entire Hex.

While they can be plotted out with any number of traditional methods, this is a quick Hex-based method.

## **POINTS AND ROUTES**

- 1. Draw 6 **points** as the corners of a hexagon, with a 7th in the centre.
  - a. Mark 3 points with circles. These are **features** that give information or set the mood.
  - b. Mark 2 with triangles. These are **dangers** to be navigated carefully.
  - c. Mark 1 with a diamond. This is **treasure,** a useful or valuable find.
  - d. Erase the final point and assign numbers to the remaining points.
- 2. Neighbouring points can be connected by three types of **route**.
  - a. Draw 3 **open** routes with a solid line. These are straightforward paths between points.
  - b. Draw 2 **closed** routes with a crossed line. Here something blocks the way, so creative thinking is required.
  - c. Draw 1 **hidden** route with a dotted line. This path is only found through specific exploration of its connecting points or local knowledge.
- 3. Make sure all points can be reached, even if one of the routes is closed or secret.
- 4. If applicable, place an **entrance** in any point, and an optional hidden entrance.

## **EXAMPLE - Blackmoss Isle**

![](_page_14_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Entrance**: A small cove, a safe landing spot on the island.

**Hidden Entrance:** Locals know of a second landing, requiring careful piloting through rocks and caves.

- 1. Stony beach overgrown with toxic black moss. Dead rock pools, smashed boat.
- 2. A tattered rope bridge over jagged rocks. Carrion Gulls harass travellers, hoping to secure their next meal.
- 3. A concealed harbour. A hidden cave leads to 6. The passageway to 4 is overgrown with toxic black moss.
- 4. A former shrine to the sea, overgrown with black moss. Now the tomb of the Salt Seer.
- 5. A waterlogged cave, swirling currents sweep away anybody not secured. Tunnel to 6 is flooded by raging waters.
- 6. The Salt Seer's hoard. Valuable treasures and his Eye of the Sea.

## **BREAKING THE RULES**

The guidelines on this page are just a starting point. Rearrange the distribution of the types of point, route, and entrance if it suits the theme of the site better.

So a sealed burial complex might have:

Points: 3 Treasures, 2 Dangers, 1 Feature Routes: 3 Closed, 2 Secret, 1 Open Entrances: 1 Entrance only

## Refereeing

## <span id="page-15-0"></span>**PRIMACY OF ACTION**

Even when using the rules for travel, exploration, and combat, remember this, the most important thing:

Past action taken by the players supersedes content generated by prompts or rules. Their deeds are reality.

Remember the core of giving players information, honouring their choices, and describing the impact of their actions.

## **GIVING INFORMATION**

The players can only make interesting choices when they are presented with difficult situations and given all of the information needed to engage with them.

## **IMPROVISATION**

When faced with a question not answered by rules, notes, or procedures, you improvise.

Anything too beneficial or too harmful creates the feeling of an arbitrary world. Instead, describe something that does at least one of the following:

- **Evokes** the flavour and themes of the area and its inhabitants.
- **Indulges** their senses. Vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste.
- **Reinforces** something that they've already learned about this place.

## **PROMPTS**

Every Knight and Myth spread has prompts across its base. These serve as cues for improvisation as needed. Spark Tables([p22](#page-21-0)) are also useful for generating ideas.

## **LUCK ROLLS**

If you need to consult the whims of fate, make a Luck Roll on a d6. A high roll favours the players, a low one does not.

In general, use these guidelines:

## **LUCK ROLL**

**1 Crisis:** Something immediately bad. **2-3 Problem:** Something potentially bad. **4-6 Blessing:** A welcome result.

## **ACTION PROCEDURE**

When the players take action the Referee works down this list:

- **1. Intent:** What are you trying to do?
- **2. Leverage:** What makes it possible?
- **3. Cost:** Would it use a resource, cause Virtue Loss, or have a side-effect?
- **4. Risk:** What's at risk? No risk, no roll. Otherwise make a Save or a Luck Roll.
- **5. Impact:** Show the consequences, honour the established risk, and move forward.

## **SUCCESS**

When the players succeed at a significant action the Referee does one of the following:

- **Advance:** Move in a good direction.
- **Disrupt:** Lessen a threat.
- **Resolve:** Put a problem to rest.

## **FAILURE**

When the players fail at a risky action they might still complete the action, but always suffer negative consequences:

- **Threaten:** Create a new problem.
- **Escalate:** Make a problem worse.
- **Execute:** Deliver on a threat.

## **IMPACT**

Whether a success or a failure, ensure that the players' actions have an observable impact on the world. The best types of impact have both immediate and lasting consequences, always moving things forward.

## **ENDING A SESSION**

At the end of each session:

- Discuss if it would feel right for a **Season** or **Age** to pass between now and the next session [\(p17\)](#page-16-0).
- If a Season or Age passes, then follow the procedure detailed.
- Ask the players if they have any plans or ambitions for the next session. This gives you a direction for any preparation you do before then.

![](_page_16_Picture_0.jpeg)

## <span id="page-16-0"></span>Each **Day** has 3 **Phases**:

- **Morning:** Sunrise to Noon.
- **Afternoon:** Noon to Sunset.
- **Night:** Sunset to Sunrise.

## Each **Year** has 3 **Seasons**:

## **Spring -** *The Green Season*

- Begins with the **Feast of the Sun**, a day of excess and revelry to strengthen both the people and the land.
- Midspring sees **Sceptremass**, where the Seat of Power gathers local rulers to renew their vows of loyalty.
- Ends with the **Tax**, a share of coins collected by the Realm.

## **Harvest -** *The Gold Season*

- Begins with the **Feast of the Stars**, a night of honours, unions, and contests.
- Midharvest sees **Eldermass**, a secretive assembly of Seers and trusted associates.
- Ends with the **Tithe**, a share of food and drink collected by the Realm.

## **Winter -** *The Grey Season*

- Begins with the **Feast of the Moon**, a solemn reflection of mortality and history.
- Midwinter sees **Kindlemass**, a sacred day of warmth and goodwill, where each home must open their doors to all.
- Ends with the **Levy**, a share of materials and crafted goods collected by the Realm.

## Each **Life** has 3 **Ages**:

- **Young:** Green, always learning.
- **Mature:** Seasoned, in their golden years.
- **Old:** Grey, considering their legacy.

When a character becomes **Mature** they reroll each Virtue on d12+d6 and keep the result if higher.

When a character becomes **Old** they reroll each Virtue on d12+d6 and keep the result if lower. Old characters lose d12 VIG at the end of each Age. If this takes them to VIG 0 they die peacefully.

## **ADVANCING TIME**

At the end of each session, or during a natural break in their journey, the group decides how much time will reasonably pass:

- **None:** Pick up where you left off.
- **Weeks:** Continue on to the next significant seasonal event.
- **Months:** Move to the next Season.
- **Years:** Begin a new Age in Spring.

If uncertain, roll:

## **PASSAGE OF TIME**

**1** Season or Age turns **now 2-3** Season or Age turns **after next session 4-6** The Season or Age **continues**

Between Seasons and Ages, Knights guard the Realm and each choose a pursuit.

## **BETWEEN SEASONS**

Restore Virtues and choose one:

- **Pilgrimage**: Learn about an unknown part of the Realm.
- **Courtesy**: Establish a new contact or earn a favour.
- **Service**: Make a small improvement to the Realm.

## **BETWEEN AGES**

Restore Virtues, gain 1 Glory, choose one:

- **Duty**: Make a significant improvement to the Realm.
- **Succession**: Establish a successor and/or have them Knighted.
- **Legacy**: Your successor gains half of your current Glory.

## **UNRESOLVED SITUATIONS**

If an important situation is left unresolved before moving to the next Season or Age, roll d6 to see how it changes:

## **UNRESOLVED SITUATIONS**

**1** It goes as **bad as it could possibly go**.

17

**2-3** It gets **worse. 4-6** It gets **better.**

![](_page_17_Picture_0.jpeg)

<span id="page-17-0"></span>Travelling consumes a whole Phase of the day and uses one of 3 methods:

- Trek: 1 Hex on foot or steed.
- Gallop: 2 Hexes on a non-Exhausted steed. The steed loses d6 VIG.
- **Cruise:** 3 Hexes by boat, or by steed on a rarely-found proper road.

When ending a phase in Wilderness, roll:

|     | WILDERNESS ROLL                                           |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Encounter the next Omen from a random Myth in this Realm. |
| 2-3 | Encounter the next Omen from the nearest Myth.            |
| 4-6 | Encounter the Hex's Landmark.<br>Otherwise all clear.     |

### HOSPITALITY

When sleeping indoors, do not make a Wilderness Roll. Manners dictate that hospitality be granted to travelling Knights. Longer stays warrant a favour in return.

#### **CAMPING**

When sleeping outdoors make a Wilderness Roll as normal, ignoring Landmarks. Hostile Omens prevent proper sleep, while others may not occur at all if they are improbable as nighttime activity.

#### SUPPLIES

Knights gather food, water, and firewood as they travel, so these are not tracked. In situations where essential needs are deprived the Company each lose d6 VIG each morning.

## NIGHT

Travelling or exploring at night causes the Company to lose d6 SPI each. If they lack a guide and light they are also travelling blind.

#### SLEEP

Each morning, all who did not get proper sleep the previous day lose d6 CLA.

#### WINTER

Anybody camping or travelling at night in Winter loses d6 vig. Most Realms also risk dire weather during Winter (see opposite).

#### **OMENS**

Each Myth has 6 Omens, listed in the order in which they are encountered. The first encounter with a specific Myth is always Omen 1, the second Omen 2 etc.

Remember **primacy of action** (p16). If the players want to hunt for the Wyvern's nest they don't have to wait for that Omen to appear if they take action themselves.

#### **MYTH HEXES**

Ending a phase in the Hex containing a Myth always reveals its next Omen without making a Wilderness Roll. When possible, the Knights also get the drop on the Omen.

#### BARRIERS

Travel through a Barrier is not normally possible, though locals might know a way. Attempting to travel through a Barrier wastes that Phase of the day, but still causes a Wilderness Roll.

#### OTHER TRAVELLING TABLES

Travellers who find themselves roaming without a proper sense of direction, or shrouded by darkness or mist, must roll when they try to move to a new Hex.

| 1                | Circle back to where you started.         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 2-3              | Drift a Hex to the Left (2) or Right (3). |
| 4-6              | Progress as planned.                      |
| TRAVELLING BLIND |                                           |

When travelling in lands at the mercy of dire weather, roll at the start of each Phase.

| DIRE WEATHER |                                                                                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1            | <b>Dire weather.</b> You can't leave the Hex and can't get proper sleep.                   |
| 2-3          | <b>Looming threat.</b> If this is rolled a second consecutive time, treat as dire weather. |
| 4-6          | <b>Fine weather</b> for travel.                                                            |

When arriving in a Holding, roll to gauge the local mood.

|     | LOCAL MOOD |                                                |
|-----|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1   |            | Occupied by a looming or recent woe.           |
| 2-3 |            | There is a sense of things in <b>decline</b> . |
| 4-6 |            | A fine mood and all seems well enough.         |

## Exploration

**THE LAY OF THE LAND**

Each Hex is large and diverse, a land within the land. Some may spend their whole lives within one. A forest Hex might have cliffs, streams, clearings, and caves.

Use Spark Tables([p22](#page-21-0)) and the prompts at the base of each Knight and Myth spread to help fill the blanks in your Hexes.

## **EXPLORATION ACTIONS**

When ruling exploration actions, follow the standard Action Procedure([p16](#page-15-0)). In particular, consider whether the action will take a whole Phase of the day to carry out.

As with other Actions, the players should know the risks before they commit to it.

If the Action calls for a Save the Company decides who rolls, using their Virtue.

Even if they fail the Save, the goal might still be achievable, but now faces an obstacle, a hostile encounter, or an additional cost.

While the cause and consequence of failure can be personal, they also represent the whims of nature, bad weather, shifting land.

If it is unclear which Virtue to use, consider the main activity involved in the risky part:

- **Vigour:** Strength or physical stamina.
- **Clarity:** Senses or mental quickness.
- **Spirit:** Social or emotional influence.

## **SEARCHING**

It takes a whole Phase to carry out a surface level sweep of an entire Hex, thoroughly search for something known to exist there, or find a vantage point.

## **VISION**

From a vantage point it's possible to get an overview of the current Hex and a general sense of what lies in neighbouring hexes, but not specific details.

**GATHERING FOLKLORE**

Everybody knows something about Myths. How much depends on who they are.

**Vassals** know about their nearest Myth, and its general direction. If it is adjacent to their home then they know its precise location. They know Landmarks in their home and neighbouring Hexes.

**Knights** and **Vagabonds** have roamed enough to know about a random Myth of the Realm and its rough direction. They also know of the nearest Landmark.

All of the above know **rumours** that warn of dangers, but not how to avoid or undo them.

**Seers** know the **rules** of all Myths, their secrets, and their locations. They know their weaknesses, and cures to their maladies. They know all Landmarks in the Realm. Such vast knowledge isn't given freely.

For example, take Myth 6, the Goblin.

Omen 2 describes "A lost lad, full of stories. Claims a little old man called him into the woods."

All locals know about children going missing, and stories of a strange old man in the woods off to the north-east.

A Seer knows that this is, in fact, the Goblin, and would know that he can only claim lost things, unable to steal for himself. They even know where to find his lair.

## Dominion

## **RULING A DOMAIN**

In return for pledging loyalty to the Seat of Power, a Holding might be granted to a Knight or influential Vassal. This forms a Domain. Wilderness Hexes and their Landmarks formally fall under the dominion of their nearest Holding.

## **THE COUNCIL**

Prestigious seats must be filled for a Domain to run smoothly. Though you may grant and revoke these roles, those who are scorned rarely go quietly.

**Steward:** Ruling in your absence, carrying your authority and the key to the treasury.

**Marshall:** Training and equipping soldiers, mustering them in times of war.

**Sheriff:** Monitoring threats within your Realm and even within your walls.

**Envoy:** Managing neighbours and providing hospitality to visitors.

**The Circle:** Rulers often invite worthy visiting Knights to sit alongside the Council as equals, an ancient tradition.

Members of your Council can be assigned to tasks. Depending on the scope these could take a Phase, a Week, or a full Season. These are handled just as normal actions([p16](#page-15-0)), with failure typically causing a **Crisis**.

## **THE COURT**

Those who serve outside the Council.

**Retainers:** Vassals taken on by individual Council members to aid in their work.

**Courtiers:** Commoners with lesser responsibilities or ceremonial honours, usually holding higher ambitions.

**Petitioners:** Representatives from outside of the Court, granted an audience to seek aid, counsel, or justice.

**Seers:** Although they live in their Sanctums they occasionally visit Court or send acolytes in their stead.

## **CRISES**

Ruling a Domain is an exercise in ongoing disaster management.

At the start of a Season or when returning from a long absence, roll:

## **CRISIS ROLL 1 Calamity**: Immediately gain 2 Crises. **2-3 Dilemma**: Choose between 2 Crises. **4-6 Prosperity**: Times are good.

Crises apply to the whole Domain, not a single character, and remain until resolved. They can be chosen by the Referee, or rolled:

- **1. Chaos** *Lawlessness in the land* Resolution: Enforce a sense of justice.
- **2. Debt -** *Dire need of coffer and coin* Resolution: Restock the treasury.
- **3. Famine -** *Empty plates, empty fields* Resolution: Get food into the stores.
- **4. Misery -** *Vassals question why they toil* Resolution: Raise the spirits of the people.
- **5. Panic -** *The weak tremble with unease* Resolution: Ensure the Vassals feel safe.
- **6. Doubt -** *Seeds of betrayal against you* Resolution: Assert your authority to rule.

## **MISRULE**

If a season ends with 3 or more unresolved Crises then the Domain goes into misrule. Vassals revolt, Knights leave, and pretenders move in on their claims.

## **CLAIMING A SEAT OF POWER**

A Seat of Power carries similar problems to a Holding, elevated to a larger scale. Threats arise from within your Court, within your Realm, and from beyond your borders.

![](_page_19_Picture_32.jpeg)

![](_page_20_Picture_0.jpeg)

*.*

## <span id="page-20-0"></span>**MUSTERING TROOPS**

A typical Seat of Power can muster 3 Warbands, other Holdings 2. The Marshall determines their training and armament.

## **TAXES, TITHES, & LEVIES**

Standard collections [\(p17\)](#page-16-0) keep the Domain running without too much strain. A Steward can squeeze more from their Vassals for a war or great project, but must roll:

|   | INCREASED COLLECTIONS |
|---|-----------------------|
| 1 | Immediate misrule.    |

**2-3** Your coffers are filled, but take a **Crisis 4-6** The Vassals **pay willingly**, mostly.

## **COURTLY CONFLICT**

Courtiers breed problems, especially when they hold leverage over their ruler, whether family influence, dark secrets, or military might. Here a ruler must tread carefully, as obvious solutions always leave at least one party feeling mistreated.

Every Season brings some drama. Spark Tables [\(p22\)](#page-21-0) can help to describe this. Roll to see how you're involved:

|     | DRAMA IN COURT                   |
|-----|----------------------------------|
| 1   | You are personally involved.     |
| 2-3 | You are involved by association. |
| 4-6 | You are not involved.            |

## **CONQUEST**

Knights live between two worlds. One of rank, oath, and rule of the worthy. The other of chaos, brutality, and rule of the strong.

Often, having the audacity to seat yourself in a Holding is enough to make you the ruler.

Holdings and Realms seized by force and left unchallenged tend to have a period of turmoil before adapting to the new status quo.

## **GRAND DESIGNS**

Work on **existing** buildings or infrastructure is generally completed by the next Season.

**New** buildings or infrastructure can be completed in a Season.

**Grand** projects such as castles and roads require an entire Age of work.

## Nature

<span id="page-21-0"></span>The majority of any Realm is wilderness, where even rough trails are a rare sight. Roll 2d12 on a Spark Table and combine the results for an improvisational prompt.

## Knights

<span id="page-25-0"></span>Roll d6 and d12. Read the d6 first. Pages list the d6 in a square, d12 in a pentagon.

Each Knight can be used for a player character or non-player Knights who are encountered wandering or ruling. Generally each player should have a different type of Knight.

Some Realms refer to Knights by honorific titles and ranks, others their given name and home, while most use their full knightly title or simply "Knight."

This is not an exhaustive list, and even those listed Knights may differ as the mantle is passed on.

Each page also includes the Seer who granted their Knighthood, witnessing the pledging of their Oath.

Each Myth lists its Omens and the cast of beings who are associated with it.

Entering or exploring the Myth's Hex always reveals its next Omen, remembering Primacy of Action [\(p16\)](#page-15-0).

The Hex itself is visually tied to the Myth.

When the group feels that a Myth is resolved the Knights each gain 1 Glory and a new Myth replaces it in the next Season.

Myths may appear at odds with their Realm, such as The Sea in a desert.

Still, these Myths must be brought to pass, so Realm and Myth can shift as needed.

- 4. A strange nasal-toned flute, left with scraps of cloth. Playing stimulates sudden grief. Lose d6 SPI, dream of the Shadow.
- 5. The Shadow, still, by a drowning-lake. They torment trespassers with visions of past sorrows. The water whispers, answering one question on behalf of the dead each day. At morning, a herd of grey deer visit the lake to show their respects.
- 6. The Company find themselves in the Shadow's world. Islands in the mist of time. The mourned past can be seen as clear as the now. None can die here, but all who leave lose d12 SPI. The Shadows are only appeased by displays of grief.

## Omens

- 1. In an itchy marsh, a severed, rubbery arm pulls itself along. Claws at anybody that interferes. Has no sense of direction, eventually withering to dense, dead flesh.
- 2. A tiny chameleon watches from a crooked branch. Hisses a warning if anybody passes near, stirring the Troll in the nearby trees, fleeing back to its home.
- 3. A burglar is fleeing from an abandoned cave, a home carved into the earth. Clumsy furniture cobbled from rock and mud. Blood on the ground, smashed bones, another dead troll limb. The burglar found nothing of value in there.
- 4. The Troll drags a dying warhorse back toward its new cave. A Knight lays dead.
- 5. Bronze, shimmering pond amongst a bog of fly-infested reeds. Disturbing the water grants a vision of the Troll being attacked by soldiers with axes, hacking the creature to bits.
- 6. Split from head to pelvis, the Troll holds itself together as it rampages, craving meat to aid the regeneration.

- 3. A sudden, broad tunnel entrance. The Dwarf leads reluctant labourers in digging out a passage to a distant Realm. He doesn't care where. The earth itself appears to bleed in the ground around the tunnel. The Dwarf seems undeterred.
- 4. Suddenly rising from the ground, three great giants of vengeful earth lash out at any people they can find.
- 5. Band of traders, labourers, and thieves from a distant Realm. Claim they arrived through the tunnel, looking for a home.

### Omens

- 1. A wide cave mouth looms from a vinecloaked cliff. It seems empty, but echoes sound slightly altered.
- 2. Three iron pilgrims attempt to seal the cave, claiming it can only cause harm.
- 3. The Cave, a familiar shape and echo. This time a glow emanates from within, revealing 3 useful crystals (see opposite).
- 4. The Cave appears again, on a new cliff face, the word "gold" echos from within. Anybody entering awakens the beast of solid darkness, which only fights to prevent entry to the Cave. Beyond the beast lies a heavy coffer of gold.
- 5. The Cave appears on a great boulder, now with eye-like holes and tooth-like stalactites. It slowly speaks, granting one question to each Knight present. It knows all and answers to the best of its ability.
- 6. A towering figure strides out of a shadow, like folds of material darkness. He is the Debt Collector, here to take payment for the Cave. He accepts anything of value, and tries to kill those who won't pay.

# Eity Auest

For the oath, for the glory, through sorrow and ache The City, that quest to which no Knight can make

A Company worthy of the City Quest continues their knightly duties as normal, but when they would encounter an Omen from a random Myth by rolling 1 on the Wilderness Roll, they instead encounter an Omen from the City Quest.

To determine the Omen, roll d12 and add the number of Omens of the City that the Company have already encountered, adding 0 if this is their first. In the case of a duplicate take the next Omen down the list. Treat rolls of higher than 24 as 24 instead.

After encountering Omen 18 or higher the City Quest ends.

## Omens

- 1. A lost traveller in finely cut cloth, armed with a strange device. He's desperate to get back to the City, telling stories of a place of coloured lights and brick towers.
- 2. On the horizon, a jagged skyline of towers, domes, impossible bridges, dotted with warm light. It fades in the next Phase.
- 3. Four strange raiders stroll up, mocking the Knights as primitives. They attempt to rob anything of value the Knights have.
- 4. A broken trail appears to have a golden hue, gradually turning to slabs of sparkling stone, impossibly smooth. After a while the road fades back to nothing.
- 5. The City Knight, returning from the City. She advises you to turn back.

禁

- 6. Three great shapes move in the sky, casting shadows over the land. Like huge, dark eggs, a growling hum. With a chorus of bangs they send an explosive barrage (2d10 blast) down onto the Company before drifting off to the horizon.
- 7. A rider in ugly red plate. She claims to be the Arch-Hellion of Jules, pressing a claim on the nearest Seat of Power. She is from the City, but smugly refuses to share any information about it.
- 8. A wide tunnel through a sheer cliff face, the other side visible. Partway through the tunnel, a rumble, a whistle, a blast of white smoke. Anyone who doesn't vacate the tunnel is struck by an immense force (3d10), which vanishes before it exits the other side of the tunnel.
- 9. Green-grey smoke washes over the land for the rest of the season. It burns slightly, but no serious effect.
- 10. A Warband of Knight-Catchers charge, aiming to preserve you for display in a museum that does not exist yet.

- 11. A metal wagon lies in ruin, various canisters and pipes lie broken within the wreckage, like nothing you've seen before. Amongst the wreckage, a metal chest contains a beautiful crystal bottle filled with fiery liquor, and a pouch of impossibly clear diamonds.
- 12. A woman in a black coat, with a broad hat. She's a science-mystic, trading wonders from the City in return for guidance to mystical places in the Realm.
- 13. A pottery-like stairway leading downward in a spiral. A green-tiled tunnel with soft light, soothing music. The exit leads to a distant point in the Realm.
- 14. A wooden case with six rifles (2d10 long) and a good amount of ammunition.
- 15. A sponge-like, metallic material has burst forth from the soil, slowly growing from beneath. Narrow tunnels lead into a chamber where ten silver ghouls sleep.
- 16. A towering, square mountain. The slightest touch reduces it to rubble, releasing the brick giant within.
- 17. Scattered plates and wires. A faint voice from a blinking light. You may ask the voice one question, which it will answer with certainty. It knows everything.
- 18. An open plain. You are utterly certain that this is where the City must be built.
- 19. A vast, empty, glittering castle. The City will grow from here with the right ruler.
- 20. The City. A hellish smoke-choked factory.
- 21. The City. All coloured lights, strange machines, and discordant music.
- 22. The stars look closer. You feel a force drawing you toward them, into the void.
- 23. A liquid light roars over you. Embrace the end or abandon your quest.
- 24. You see now. The City was a lie.

## Start & Scope **THOUGHTS**

## **PLAY**

**Ref:** Okay we should talk about the start and scope of the campaign. For the start you can be Knights-Errant, newly knighted and out for glory, Knights-Gallant who are older, with a place in Court, or Knights-Tenant if you want to start ruling a Holding. To be honest that sounds a bit much for me at the moment, but we could do either of the others.

**Tal:** I assumed we'd be starting out as new Knights, but starting in Court could be cool.

**Moss:** Yeah I'm happy with either.

**Ref:** Well let's talk about scope before we lock it in. This is how many sessions we'll run and how time will advance across them. I know we agreed to run for 6 weeks, so that would fit a chronicle. We can always carry on afterwards if we're enjoying it.

**Moss:** Yeah I'm away for two weeks and I think Tal has that other campaign?

**Ref:** Sure, we'll do six sessions then. The book suggests each session should end by moving onto the next Season, and at the end of winter we'll advance to a new Age, which means advancing like twenty years or so.

**Tal:** Right… but what if we end the session right in the middle of something?

**Ref:** I mean we don't have to set it in stone, but things persist between Seasons. Maybe we'll leave the exact timing of the Age-skip loose so that we can do it when it feels right. It'll be neat to look back on the campaign and have a proper span of your Knights' lives.

**Tal:** Okay that makes sense.

**Moss:** I guess we try to finish each session in a place that makes sense too, right? Like we won't end right in the middle of a combat?

**Ref:** Yeah, and if that happens we can always finish the fight next time and do the time-skip mid-session. It doesn't take long.

**Tal:** Great. Well if we're doing that shall we start as brand new Knights?

**Moss:** Sounds good to me.

For those used to more traditional campaign structures, the between-session time jumps of Mythic Bastionland can seem daunting.

It's understandable that some players don't like the idea of releasing control of their characters for these "off camera" months or years that pass during such an advancement.

Of course, the intent of this rule isn't to leave players with a lack of control, so here Ref does a good job of reassuring Tal and Moss.

I think Ref strikes a good balance between keeping plans loose by suggesting some flexibility in when to advance the Seasons and Ages, but also making it clear that these advances are planned into the campaign, explaining why they want to include them.

I'd possibly be clearer here, telling the group that each session will always be the start of a new Season, and deciding ahead of time which session will also advance to the next Age. This is no more right or wrong than Ref's approach here, and comes down to your own preferences and your experience of playing with your group.

They eventually settle on starting as Knights-Errant, which is where I expect the majority of groups to begin their games. Ref even goes as far as to recommend against the most advanced starting point.

Even if a group is unlikely to want to begin as experienced Knights, it's worth highlighting these options at the start of the campaign. Just showing them as possibilities helps players see the likely direction for their Knights and gives a bit more context to where they might be after some Seasons and Ages.

## Character Creation

## **PLAY**

**Ref:** So in this game you're both Knights, but you'll have different strengths and weaknesses. Start by rolling your Virtues. They're Vigour, Clarity, and Spirit. For each you'll roll a d12 and a d6 and add them together. High is better, 10 is average.

*Ref hands a character sheet to each player. They start rolling their Virtues.*

**Tal:** Okay, so Vigour 11, Clarity 14, Spirit 7.

**Moss:** I got Vigour 6! Urgh. At least my Clarity and Spirit are higher, 10 and 12.

**Ref:** Yeah that's pretty bad! Don't worry though, just means you'll need to be clever. The scores might get better later as your character ages. There's this rule where… Actually, scrap that for now. Roll d6 for your Guard. This is how good you are at avoiding getting hit or taking lasting Damage.

**Tal:** Okay, 3, I guess that's okay.

**Moss:** I got 6! Guess I'm a survivor.

**Ref:** Okay now you each get to be one of these Knights.

*Ref fans through the book, showing some of the entries for Knights.*

**Ref:** The book says you can choose from here or roll. What do you think?

**Moss:** Obviously we should roll.

**Tal:** Oh I dunno, I don't want to be stuck with a character I don't like.

**Ref:** Okay how about we roll, but if you hate what you get then you can choose instead.

**Tal:** Yeah, thanks.

*They both roll Knights, getting the Moss and Talon Knights.*

**Tal:** I get a bird? I'll stick with this one!

**Ref:** Great, so this gives you some gear and a special thing you can do. Let's get it onto your character sheets and we can get started.

## **THOUGHTS**

When getting the players started with the game I like to get them rolling their character as soon as possible, before I even start telling them about the world. The things they discover in making their character will get them immersed in the world right away.

It's good that Ref gives a bit of context for Virtues. If you've played a lot of RPGs it's easy to assume that everybody will work out the average of d6+d12, but just telling the players that 10 is average gives them a point of reference for their character.

Getting bad rolls here can be disheartening, so it's good to see Ref reassuring Moss that their low Vigour score isn't going to make his character useless.

We can see that Ref almost goes into explaining the rules for characters ageing, and how their Virtues can increase, but decides not to overload the players right now. At this point it's enough for the players to know that their scores can change later, they don't need to know the details while they're focused on their brand new character.

On our very first example, Ref is already breaking the rules. The character creation process says nothing about letting the characters roll a Knight and then decide whether to keep them or roll a different entry instead, but Ref sees that Tal is feeling anxious about getting a character she doesn't like, and decides to give the players the best of both worlds.

Ref could have stood firm, insisting that Tal either rolls a character or chooses one, but instead Ref took the chance that Tal would probably be happy with her character, but would appreciate the backup option if she didn't like the Knight she rolled.

This can go the other way, with some players finding it too much choice to be handed a list of 72 Knights, so would rather let the dice decide. A huge part of the Referee's role is sensing the best option for their group. If in doubt, just ask the players and trust them to be reasonable.

177

## Teaching the Rules

## **PLAY**

**Tal:** Okay, now the rules?

**Ref:** So this is a bit more complex than Into the Odd, but the core is the same. Wait, were you both here when we played that?

**Tal:** Yeah I think I remember all the rules.

**Moss:** No, I missed that week.

**Ref:** Okay I'll start from scratch then. When you do something risky I'll ask you to roll a Save, so you'll roll a d20 and try to get equal or less than your relevant Virtue. So, Moss, if you made a Vigour Save then you'd need to roll 6 or less on a d20.

**Moss:** Got it. I guess I'll be avoiding those.

**Ref:** Combat is… you know what, we'll deal with combat when it happens. For now you just need to know that the die type next to your weapon is the die you roll when you Attack with it. So Moss your cudgel does d8 Damage. Oh, and you have a shield which gives you Armour 1, meaning you'll take 1 less Damage from attacks against you. You can bash with it too for extra Damage.

**Moss:** Right. Does my bad Vigour score make my attacks weaker too?

**Ref:** No actually. There are times when it will matter, but it won't affect your Damage.

**Moss:** Oh right, that's good then.

*Ref scans over some of the other pages of rules and prepared notes.*

**Ref:** Yeah the rest we'll just deal with as we get to it. I'll give you plenty of warning so I won't just drop a horrible rule on you!

**Tal:** What about this Ability on my sheet?

**Ref:** Right, right. Your Ability is a special thing that only you can do. There are also Feats linked to combat but… you know what let's just get started and we'll do a little combat brief when it happens.

**Moss:** Sounds good, let's go.

## **THOUGHTS**

Here I show my bias toward getting the game started as soon as you can, backloading as much of the rules explanation as possible.

The game is designed in such a way that players don't need to know all of the rules to begin with, but there are some important considerations with this approach.

Players may be relieved that they don't need to learn rules immediately, but some may worry that they're going to make a critical mistake without knowing all of the details of how the game works.

Here Ref starts with the bare minimum, explaining how Saves work. This is a nice rule to start with as it's simple and gives further context for the information on the players' character sheets. They get a little bogged down talking about weapons and armour, and frankly I think Ref could have skipped this whole section, sticking to the line that combat will be explained when it happens.

It's natural for players to ask about other parts of their character sheet that they don't yet understand, here their Ability. Ref could have just said "we'll deal with that later" but I like that they at least gave the context for them, if not the actual rules in detail. Now Tal understands generally what Feats are, but hasn't needed to learn exactly how they work in game terms.

Something that Ref missed here is explaining the objective of the characters. In this game the Oath gives Knights a clear purpose, so I would encourage Ref to at least explain the Oath and maybe touch on how they'll be gaining Glory.

## Primacy of Action

## **PLAY**

*The Company encounter an Omen of the Troll, which the book describes as a clumsy burglar fleeing from the Troll's cave-house.*

**Ref:** Running away from the cave you see a figure. Actually, you recognise her, it's Sam the burglar.

*Ref had previously used Sam as an incidental character, randomly taking them as a prompt when they needed a shady character. By coincidence the same character has now been prompted by an Omen.*

**Moss:** I guess she got over her broken leg?

**Ref:** Wait, what happened again?

**Tal:** She got caught trying to break into the Seer's tower, remember? The guards beat her up and later we found out her leg was broken, but that old woman was looking after her? I think this was after we did the Season change, so can't have been long ago in game.

**Ref:** Ah yeah, right…

*Slightly awkward pause.*

**Ref:** No, no, this is fine! Well above anything else, all that stuff you remember definitely happened, but sure enough you see Sam sprinting away from the cave, no sign of a broken leg. Weird huh?

**Moss:** Huh.

**Tal:** Okay let's flag her down and see what's up.

*Meanwhile Ref flicks to a random page scouring the prompts for an explanation. They see "Toxic Plants", and during the conversation Sam explains that her leg was miraculously healed by a travelling herbalist, but they used methods and materials that nobody had seen before.*

*Ref makes a secret note that these bonemending methods use toxic plants that are going to spell future trouble for Sam. They plant the seed by having Sam have a small coughing fit in the middle of their conversation before laughing it off.*

## **THOUGHTS**

Never underestimate the power of saying "yeah, weird huh?" when you slip a massive contradiction into the game by mistake.

Here we see a group running into a situation that calls for Ref to remember the *Primacy of Action*, essentially the idea that events that have already happened supersede new events that are generated through Omens or prompts when establishing the ongoing fiction of the world.

So if you cut off the Wyvern's wings then they don't grow back because the next Omen describes it flying above.

Here it's a character reappearing in an Omen, doing something unlikely, given the events that have already occurred.

Ref could have just said "okay, it's NOT Sam, but she looks just like her", though revealing a secret twin is a risky play.

Remember the whole point of this is to make the world feel real and not to undermine the players' previous choices. Here the players are well aware that Ref is pulling this new healer tangent out of thin air, but if they deliver it with confidence and make it an interesting addition to the fiction then the players will take it in their stride.

As with other moments of improvisation, it's best to keep the improvised content as something neither overtly beneficial or harmful to the players. Players accept that improvisation happens, but moments with significant positive or negative impact are best when they feel like part of the impartial mechanisms of the game, rather than something implemented at the whims of the Referee.

Here, even just flicking to another page of the book to scour for prompts can make the improvised content feel more real, at least spreading the perceived responsibility between the Referee and the book.

## Ærtting Rules Wrong

#### PLAY

The players have split up briefly. Moss has just been in lone combat, driving a mighty newt back into the river.

**Ref:** Okay, if you're taking a moment to rest you can restore your Guard back to full. That Vigour loss will be harder to recover.

**Moss:** Oof. That thing took away like 4 of my VIG with one bite.

**Ref:** Wait... Hang on. Your max VIG is 6 right? If you lost half of that in one Attack it should have been a Mortal Wound.

Moss: Oh. Well, I'd probably be dead right, since Tal wasn't around to help me?

**Tal:** We can say Tal showed up to help?

**Ref:** You know what, I don't think we should go back and change things. The combat went the way it did, we'll just make sure we remember next time.

Moss: Aah, I dunno, I feel bad. Feels like I've cheated.

Tal: I don't feel cheated!

**Moss:** No I mean like I should be dead. I want things to be fair.

**Ref:** But you probably would have used the Deny Feat to block the Damage if you'd known, right? I think the end result would be the same. Not like you came out without a scratch. If it's really important then we can roll back and redo the combat. Maybe just go back to right before you took that bite?

Ref scrambles through their notes to try to work out who had taken Damage.

**Moss:** No, no, you're right that feels dumb. As long as you both know it was an accident.

**Ref:** Yeah of course. Hey, first excuse I get this newt is coming back to finish the job.

#### **THOUGHTS**

This is going to happen. You might notice immediately, or you might realise months into a campaign that you've interpreted a rule differently than the book intended.

The important thing is that you look back and ask yourself what harm has been done.

In most cases the game will have worked just fine. Maybe things will feel better when you start using the correct rule, but I'd warn against going back to change the past, even if the consequences would be severe.

When this happens in plain view of the group you can encounter Moss' reaction here. Some players won't mind, or might enjoy that they got away with something, but others can feel that the reality of the game world has somehow been compromised.

Ref handled it pretty well here, explaining that the situation wouldn't be all that different with the correct ruling. I think they were right to offer to roll things back for Moss, but I'm also glad that Moss didn't take them up on it. I'm not sure what would be gained by repeating the combat.

But what if the opposite had happened. What if Moss had been killed by the newt, but later realised that the correct rule would have had them live? This is a more difficult situation to manage. Here I'd lean on the principle of being generous to the players, but try to do so without completely invalidating the play that's already happened. Perhaps Moss was dragged into the water, assumed to be dead, but re-emerged days later. If Moss had already created a new Knight, perhaps that character becomes a non-player character, being a new contact in the Realm.

## Getting Stuck

## **PLAY**

*The Knights have just encountered the final Omen of the Wyvern Myth, killing the beast. They've set up camp and rested for the night.*

**Ref:** Okay, brand new day, no wyvern eating the locals! Feels good, right?

**Tal:** Yeah! Moss, what should we do now?

**Moss:** I guess we're kinda free aren't we.

*Tal and Moss look over the map for a while, recapping where they've already been.*

**Tal:** Yeah… I dunno. Whatever is good.

**Moss:** Hm.

*Hesitation as both players look at each other.*

**Ref:** If in doubt, remember your Oath.

*Ref taps the Oath on each character sheet.*

**Moss:** Yeah. I mean I guess we could just go looking for Myths.

**Ref:** Speaking to the locals is the best way to get information. You swore to protect the Realm after all. You haven't been into this marsh yet though, you could just chance it.

**Moss:** No I say we head to the nearest Holding and get some leads. Let's go to that one right there.

*They go through the normal travel procedure, then Ref realises they don't have anything planned for this Holding.*

**Ref:** Okay. Actually, I just need to make some rolls for this place. Is now a good time for a little break?

**Tal:** Yeah I wouldn't mind a drink.

*Tal goes to get a drink, Moss stays at the table checking his phone. Ref rolls some prompts and makes brief notes for the Holding, a few characters there, and the Myths that they each know about. After a couple of minutes they're done. Tal returns.*

**Ref:** Right, so following the trail to this Holding you can hear drums and flutes. Sounds like there's a celebration on.

## **THOUGHTS**

Every game session has its high energy moments and those that are more subdued. The latter shouldn't be feared, but there are certainly times when a little direction or urgency can keep things moving.

Here Ref gave the players plenty of opportunity to pick a new direction for themselves after a big success. In these situations where the players are told "you can go anywhere!" it's not uncommon to see them overwhelmed with choice, or nobody wanting to take the lead.

Ref encouraged the players to think creatively by reminding them of their Oath, a good fallback for moments like this.

An alternative approach is to throw something at the players that immediately requires attention. A hostile encounter, screams in the distance, a looming storm. Here I think Ref made the right call in not doing that, as it may have cut short the opportunity for the players to bask in a little moment of calm after their wyvern fight.

Of course, the difficult thing with giving players this much freedom is that the Referee is likely to have to improvise what lies ahead. Holdings and Landmarks are a good example, as they're often little more than a marker on the map until the players decide to actually visit one.

If Ref were feeling more confident they could have just rolled frantically on some prompts and described the Holding on the fly as the players listened. Sometimes this pressure helps the Referee create unexpected ideas.

Instead, they called for a short break, something that works well in moderation. Taking too many of these breaks can leave the game feeling disjointed, but here it feels like the group was ready for it, so it was a good opportunity for Ref to spend a little time preparing ahead. I just hope Ref remembers to take a break of their own at some point.

## Taking Action

## **PLAY**

**Ref:** With its walls torn down, the village is now a bit of a sitting duck if the Legion decide to attack again.

**Tal:** We could stay and guard them but the Seer told us the Legion always comes back in greater numbers, right?

**Moss:** Yeah, how about we help them build some better defences?

*Ref flips to the Action Procedure to remind themselves of the steps.*

**Ref:** Okay, Intent. So what are you actually trying to do? Get the walls back to how they were? Make them even better?

**Moss:** Could we make them better?

**Ref:** Well let's work through the rest of the steps before we commit to that. What's your Leverage for this? How are you actually going to make it happen?

**Tal:** The serfs here would be on board with helping with the work, right? Plenty of wood around too.

**Ref:** Yeah. With the limited skill, materials, and time you have I think the Intent is going to be restricted to getting it patched up as a solid but makeshift wall.

**Moss:** Fair.

**Ref:** Cost… it's taking up time and the work of the local serfs but they're already inclined to help out. Risk… now I don't think the Legion are coming imminently, so there's no risk of them showing up before the work is done. That means there's no need to roll if you're happy to spend the time on this.

**Tal:** Yeah, let's do it.

**Ref:** So you gather the serfs and spend the afternoon chopping wood and cobbling together a ramshackle wall. Doesn't look like much but at least it's a line of defence against the Legion. The sun sets as you admire your work.

**Moss:** Well it's something but we need a proper plan to beat them for good.

## **THOUGHTS**

Here we see Ref work through the 5 steps of the Action Procedure:

Intent, Leverage, Cost, Risk, Impact.

It would be lovely if those five words formed a mnemonic, but it wasn't meant to be.

Talking through the specific stages by name is a good way to help internalise the process, but not strictly necessary once the group is comfortable with it.

Also notable is that Ref feels happy leaving the Intent somewhat loose until the group have discussed Leverage. Working through the steps in order doesn't mean you have to lock everything in as you go.

I'm glad Ref doesn't get bogged down in the detail of how long it takes to build a wall, how many workers you need, how much material. No Referee can know all these things, and slowing down the game to brush up on the logistics of wall construction is unlikely to improve the game. Here we're interested in the fact that the players want to invest time in performing this action, and the impact it has on the ongoing fiction.

There's more transparency from Ref than you might expect, outright telling the players that the Legion aren't coming back today. You want the world to have mystery, but it's also important to give players the information they need to make their decision. If it was uncertain, Ref might have said "there's a slim chance the Legion will come back today" or "there's a high chance the Legion will come back today", keeping a mental note of the odds they would use on the Luck Roll to determine this later.

Giving them certainty here lets them get on with making the decision instead of agonising about something that the Referee knows won't happen.

![](_page_182_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Ref:** Right, so it's the dawn of a new day.

*Ref points to the pawn on the player's map showing their location.*

**Ref:** To recap, you're here. Other than the elevated camping spot you found it's rather unpleasant bog as far as the eye can see. The air feels damp and mushroomy.

*Both players look at the map and start to point at other Hexes.*

**Moss:** We could make it to this Holding by nightfall. Get some hospitality and actually speak to some locals?

**Tal:** Yeah but we know these woods over here are where the Goblin was last seen. Wait, how far can we actually see? Can we see those woods?

**Ref:** Not from your camp, but they're so far away that you'd only get a distant view even from a vantage point. You'd see there are woods, but couldn't spot a person there.

**Moss:** Okay let's go toward the Holding and do some information gathering. We'll just Trek as we're not in a rush.

**Tal:** While we're travelling can I search for any other travellers we could speak to? I can see through my raven's eyes remember.

**Ref:** Yeah that'll help for sure. No real risk here so we'll just make it a Luck Roll. With your raven you'll certainly find somebody, but this is more about how far away they are.

*Tal rolls a d6, scoring 5.*

**Ref:** Sure, there's somebody travelling not far from here, let me see who we've got.

*Ref decides to roll a random prompt for a person, scoring 1 and 11. They'll also use the State prompt from the same page. The result is "lost Knight" and "nurturing".*

**Ref:** Through your raven's eyes you see an armoured figure riding on horseback, a smaller figure on a pony trailing behind them. Looks like a Knight and their Squire. You've got enough warning to skirt around them, or are you going to move closer?

## **THOUGHTS**

In my experience as a Referee, you can't recap too often. In this game it's especially useful to recap the geography of the world, as there's a lot of travelling into new areas. The Hex map is useful, but it's up to the Referee to make the Realm feel like a real place.

Ref goes beyond just describing the sights of the area, indulging in other senses. Here the feel of the air and the stink of the bog.

It seems like the players both understand the basics of travel in this game, knowing how long it takes to reach a certain point, understanding the importance of speaking to locals. This is something best learned through play, rather than being frontloaded into a rules explanation.

When a player is unsure about an element of exploration (here Tal asking how far she can see), the Ref can explain it with the context of a situation she's actually invested in.

When Tal decides to move she specifies that they are Trekking, using the actual game term. When new players are learning they might say something like "we'll move to here" and it's worth clarifying what they actually mean in game terms, ensuring that they're happy with how their decision will be implemented mechanically.

Ref leans on a Luck Roll here for a situation that didn't have any risk, but was still uncertain in outcome. Perfect use of that type of roll.

To get a prompt for what the raven finds, Ref rolls a Knight and uses the prompts on that page. They could also have simply flicked to a random page if they wanted inspiration quickly, but the dice are generally preferable to get a wider spread of results.

When Ref describes what they see their description ends with a choice that the players must make. I try to do this as often as I can. Remember, the most powerful words in any RPG are "what do you do?".

![](_page_183_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Ref:** You see light flickering from within the cave. It's maybe 30ft away through the trees.

**Moss:** Any signs of life around the cave?

**Ref:** It's pretty dark here other than the light from the cave. I assume you put your torches out before you started sneaking up here?

**Moss:** Yeah, makes sense.

**Ref:** Well even under the moonlight you can make out shadows of movement. Looks like someone is moving around inside the cave. You also spot a silhouette standing guard, outside, a solid looking figure.

**Tal:** Wait, I have a plan. Are they carrying a weapon? I could send my raven to steal it if it's on the ground. She specialises in stealing, after all.

**Ref:** They're definitely armed, but let's do a Luck Roll to see if they're carrying it. We'll call it straight 50/50.

*Ref rolls a d6, scoring 2. This means fortune does not favour the characters.*

**Ref:** You can see a mace hung on their belt. Your raven could still go for it, but would need a Save to avoid the guard's attention.

**Tal:** Let's do it. CLA Save for my raven?

**Ref:** Go for it.

*Tal rolls a 19, failing the Save.*

**Ref:** Your raven swoops down on the unsuspecting guard, grasping at his mace with her talons. The guard grabs onto the haft, wrenching it free from her grip and winding up to strike. What's she doing?

**Tal:** Get her out of there! Actually, she can fly off in the other direction, away from us. Might cause a distraction.

**Ref:** Let's see if he falls for it…

I like that Ref is so transparent with their Luck roll here. We all know the classic image of the gamemaster rolling dice secretly behind a screen, but I make the vast majority

of my rolls out in the open. They could have gone further and had one of the players roll the die, but either way works.

the die, but either way works.

Rather, the opportunity to

Ref also shows generosity to the players in assuming they put out their torches before sneaking up to the cave. They could have used this as a "Gotcha!" moment to make the players feel stupid but that style has never appealed to me. I tend to assume that the characters are at least competent. Players will make enough bad decisions on their own without saddling them with characters that do the same.

I think Ref handled the approach to the cave well by ensuring that the players are wellinformed and have plenty of opportunity to make choices. The Save roll only came into play when Tal decided to take the risky action, knowing that there would be a Save.

If Ref had simply called for a Save without the players knowing that they were taking a risk, it can create an overly tense environment at the table, where players feel like they're never safe. While this might sound appealing in some scenarios, I find players respond much more positively to situations where they suffer the consequences of their own choices and actions, rather than the seemingly random cruelty of the game world.

When the Raven fails the Save, Ref could have had the guard immediately strike the bird, launching into combat. Instead they took a softer approach, giving the players a chance to respond before the attack.

Neither option is right or wrong here, and the sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. If failure spirals into disaster too quickly then the players might feel too much at the mercy of the dice, but if consequences feel too soft then they may feel that their choices and rolls aren't having any meaningful impact on the progress of the game.

![](_page_184_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Ref:** The boar is huge, like a hay bale. Its eyes dead and black like a shark. It stands taut, as if it could charge any minute.

*Moss and Tal discuss a plan briefly.*

**Tal:** Can I climb a tree? Is there one nearby?

**Ref:** Sure, we're in a forest. You scramble up without any trouble.

**Moss:** I'll get under the tree and try to bait the boar into charging me, then Tal will dive down onto it when it gets close.

**Ref:** Hm, I think moving to the tree and climbing it is already an action for this turn. If you bait the boar over then it'll get to charge you before you can respond.

**Moss:** Fine, I hoist up my shield.

**Ref:** The boar charges at Moss and…

*Rolls d10 for Damage, scoring 9. This is reduced to 8 because of Moss's shield.*

**Ref:** Eight Damage! So the boar…

**Moss:** Woah, hang on. I'll use *Deny* on that, trying to take the brunt on my shield.

**Ref:** Okay, you use *Deny.* That's a SPI Save to avoid *Fatigue.*

*Deny removes the die and Moss passes the Fatigue Save.*

**Moss:** Definitely worth it. Spring the trap! I Attack with my cudgel and…

**Tal:** I pounce with my hookhammer, which gets +d8 when leaping down.

**Ref:** Okay, Moss, you in too?

**Moss:** Yeah let's roll.

*Tal rolls her 2d8 scoring 3 and 5, Moss rolls d8 and d4 scoring 2 and 8. The highest single die is 8 and the 5 is spent to perform a Bolster Gambit, increasing the Damage by 1.*

**Moss:** Nine Damage!

**Ref:** Great! Let's see if this pig can survive that Attack.

## **THOUGHTS**

I like that Ref has the boar pose an immediate threat, but gives the players time to discuss a plan. They could have gone even further by having the boar already charging toward them, giving a sense of urgency to their choice.

Some questions don't need a roll. If your players are in a forest and say "is there a tree nearby?" then the answer is obvious.

We've seen Ref be generous up to this point, but here they draw a line and tell Moss that they can't carry out their whole plan in a single turn.

What would have happened if they let Moss do all of this in a single turn? I don't think there would be much harm done, but allowing this sort of turn in every combat might leave opponents feeling too easy to deal with. I like a cunning plan in a fight, but I also like giving the enemy a chance to respond to the players' actions before suffering the consequences.

Moss uses the *Deny* feat to ignore the Damage from the boar, but had to interrupt Ref in order to do this. If they hadn't used the Feat then they'd be facing a Mortal Wound.

A less confident player might have missed their opportunity to do this, so I'd have liked to see Ref give them a moment to consider before they start narrating the Damage, maybe even giving them a reminder that they have access to *Deny.*

As with so many things there's a balance here. You want to give the players ample information and time to make these decisions, and offer guidance to new players, but no player wants to feel like the Referee is running their character for them.

![](_page_185_Picture_0.jpeg)

*The Knights are fighting a huge crocodile.*

**Ref:** So far you haven't got a good hit in on this beast, but it's looking worn down. What do you want to do?

**Tal:** It seems nasty, but we could leave it be.

**Moss:** It's pretty close to the bridge though. It attacked us, so how do we know it won't just attack the next travellers that pass by?

**Ref:** Remember "Protect the Realm" is part of your Oath.

**Tal:** You're right, let's take it on. I'll go in with my hookhammer.

**Moss:** I'll swing my cudgel. I'll *Smite* too.

*Moss rolls d8 from their cudgel and d12 for Smiting, scoring 9 and 3. He passes his VIG Save to avoid Fatigue from Smiting. Tal rolls her own d6, getting a 6.*

**Tal:** So I can use the 6 for a Gambit, right?

**Ref:** Yeah so you can Bolster the total Damage by 1 or do something else. This croc is strong, so it'll be tricky to do fancy stuff unless Moss uses the 9 for a Strong Gambit.

**Tal:** What about *Impairing* a weapon? Would that work on an animal?

**Ref:** Yeah, you could smash its jaw to prevent it biting next turn. It gets a Save though.

**Moss:** I could use the 9 to drive it under the bridge to set it up for one of your diving attacks next turn.

**Tal:** Could we just drive it away from the fight altogether? We don't need to kill it.

**Ref:** No Gambits can't do something that would outright end the combat, just grant a temporary advantage.

**Tal:** Okay, how about I hit it, then Moss jumps on its back to hold its jaws shut? That's *Impairing* a weapon, right? And using the 9 it doesn't get to make a Save.

**Moss:** Sounds like a plan.

## **THOUGHTS**

Gambits can be tricky. You want them to feel impactful and exciting, but they shouldn't be enough to completely resolve the combat.

On a tangent, I like that the Referee gently reminds players of their Oath here. Especially early in a campaign it's useful to keep the Oath at the forefront of their minds.

Here the Referee offers some examples to Tal on what the Gambit could do. I'd perhaps remind them that these examples aren't a restrictive list, and they could carry out another effect if they had something in mind.

It's good to see they don't take the "*Impair* a weapon" example too literally, understanding the intent of the example, that it's an opportunity to temporarily weaken the attack power of the opponent. You could read the "trapping their shield" example in the same way, perhaps exposing the crocodile's belly to allow them to ignore its Armour score on their next Attack. It's impossible to cover all possible uses of a Gambit, so it's more important to understand the principles.

Here, Ref demonstrates these principles, telling the players that they can't just drive the crocodile away, as that would outright end the encounter, something too powerful for the intent of a Gambit.

Although the Gambit rule also applies to enemy attacks, I'd be careful straying too far from the suggested effects against player characters. Springing nasty surprises on players as the result of a Gambit can create fun moments, but they should abide by the same restrictions as the players.

## Unusual Attacks

## **PLAY**

*Moss is in the middle of a duel against a rival Knight that's been tormenting him.*

**Moss:** Right. So instead of swinging my cudgel I'll draw my dagger and try to stab him right through the eye.

**Ref:** Erm… hang on.

*Ref flicks through the combat rules, thinking about how best to make a ruling*

**Ref:** Okay, so what are you actually trying to achieve with this? Like kill him in a single stab? Blind him permanently? Temporarily?

**Moss:** Hmm, I want to make sure even if I can't kill him I'll leave him without an eye.

**Ref:** Right. I mean as far as killing him goes, you're already trying to do that with a normal Attack. You could do a *Smite* if you really want to try to take him out, but if it's more about leaving a lasting mark we could… hang on…

*Ref looks through the rules a bit more*

**Ref:** Yeah how about we do it as a *Smite* but instead of the extra Damage you'll leave a mark. Probably only makes sense if you actually Wound him too, so you'll need to take him down to 0GD. I don't think you could do this to any old opponent, but here there's clearly hatred between the two of you.

**Moss:** Yeah that sounds fair.

*Moss rolls his Attack and successfully Wounds his enemy. He fails the Save to avoid becoming Fatigued.*

**Ref:** So sure enough, you thrust your dagger at his eye and… urgh, you get the idea! He clutches his face, screaming, but he's still standing. You breathe heavily, feeling the adrenaline running through your body.

## **THOUGHTS**

Even with Feats, Gambits, and Scars, players will sometimes want to cause a specific effect with their Attack. Here Ref falls back on the standard Action Procedure. It's easy to get bogged down in the specifics of what the character is doing, but here it's useful to know what the player is actually trying to achieve.

Ref could have absolutely ruled this as an attempt to perform a Gambit, but I understand that this eye-gouging attack might feel beyond the scope of that rule. I think ruling it as a Gambit with a Clarity Save to dodge the stab would work just fine, encouraging the player to *Smite* to improve their chances of getting a Strong Gambit*.*

It's good that Ref clarifies that with a normal attack the character is already assumed to be trying to cause maximum harm to their target, and going beyond that is usually covered with a *Smite*. Taking this as a starting point, they change the Feat to apply extra long-term harm instead of simply improving the normal Damage of the Attack.

Importantly, the details of the ruling are explained to Moss before he confirms he wants to go through with it. A player might then decide it's no longer worth it. At this point the Referee can suggest an alternative, or the player might decide to go ahead with a normal Attack or Feat.

I also appreciate that Ref made it clear that this is a bespoke ruling for the current combat, leveraged by the established hatred between the combatants. If Moss tried something similar in another situation the ruling could be different.

There's clearly a bit of discomfort from Ref in having to describe the eye-gouge. In a game with this much opportunity for combat, and a system for Scars, there's always going to be a bit of gore, but it's perfectly acceptable to draw a veil over the grisly details if the group isn't fully comfortable with them, as Ref does here. This is something that becomes easier to judge through experience playing with the same group.

## The Upper Hand

## **PLAY**

*Moss and Tal are sparring using wooden swords (d6 hefty) and light shields (A1). Ref has ruled that any Damage sustained from this can be shaken off afterwards.*

**Ref:** Okay so you both agree that this is a duel, right? That means you'll roll and deal Damage simultaneously.

**Moss:** Okay, let's go.

*Both players make a normal Attack to begin with. Moss rolls 2, Tal 3.*

**Ref:** So you're both sort of feeling each other out first, wooden sword clattering against shield, a few probing jabs. No sharp blade to worry about, but a wooden sword to the ribs isn't a barrel of laughs.

**Tal:** Hey, Moss, aren't you scared you'll fall in the mud again like when you fought that brand new Squire?

**Moss:** Hey!

**Ref:** Are you actually trying to distract Moss here? It might backfire and give an opening.

**Tal:** Yeah sure.

**Ref:** Okay, Moss, make a SPI Save.

*Moss rolls a 10, passing the Save. Ref looks at the Bonus Attack Dice section of the rules.*

**Ref:** Okay, Moss, you keep your cool as Tal mocks you, capitalising on her distraction to drive her back onto a patch of gnarled roots. You'll get +d8 on your Attack this turn.

**Tal:** Argh, fair enough I guess.

*Both players roll to Attack again, Moss getting +d8 this time. Moss rolls 3 and 7, keeping the 7, and Tal gets 4. The shields take this down to 6 and 3 Damage.*

**Ref:** Tal, you struggle with your footing here, letting Moss knock your attacks aside and smack you across the head with his wooden sword. You're down to VIG 7 so it's a Wound, but you're still in the fight. What do you both do next?

## **THOUGHTS**

In combat, sometimes one side has a clear upper hand. Consider two Knights fighting in pitch darkness, one with perfect nightvision.

While these are straightforward, more often players will try to earn the upper hand.

Gambits are one way to represent this, especially using *Smite* or *Focus* to improve your chances, but there are other options.

There are various ways do this, and here we see Tal taking a risk. There are a few ways this can go. The classic is "roll a Save, if you pass then you get a bonus to your Attack; if you fail then something bad happens instead" but there's a lot of fine tuning that can be done in there. Here, Ref has Moss make the Save instead of Tal. I think either would have worked, but here it makes sense as the question is "will Moss keep his cool?" rather than whether Tal knows what to say.

Even with risky actions, there are cases where you might not call for a Save, and just allow a bonus in return for some other cost. Maybe if you fight recklessly then both sides get +d8 to attacking each other. If the opponent joins in the recklessness then maybe it goes up to +d10! Here the risk element is still present, even without a Save.

The second method is through having useful information**.** Perhaps you've learned something that would help here. This is how I might handle the classic "hit the monster in their weak spot". Not glowing targets, but a reward for going out and talking to hunters and those who have fought the creature before. That stone mammoth has VIG 19, Armour 3, so getting a +d10 to every Attack because you learn of its hatred of fire is practically necessary.

The last method is to reward good preparation: action now to enhance action later. The classic is "setting up" an ally for their Attack, or driving the enemy into a disadvantageous position with a Gambit. In essence, if a player can point back to a previous action that set up the current Attack I'm happy to give them a bonus for it.

## Taking Damage

## **PLAY**

*Tal and Moss are fighting against a Warband from a neighbouring Realm. They've already taken Damage from arrow fire.*

**Ref:** Okay, now it's the Warband's turn. As you're both individual combatants, they get +d12 and gain Blast*,* attacking both of you.

*Ref rolls d8 and d12 for each target, taking the highest single die against each. The dice against Tal are 8 and 5; the dice against Moss 8 and 7.*

**Ref:** The horde of attackers surge onto you, spears and axes coming from all directions. Both attacks are *Bolstered*, so you're both facing 9 Damage. You both have 3 Armour so we can knock those down to 6.

**Tal:** I'll stand firm using *Deny* on the 8.

*Ref removes the 8, leaving the 5. Tal passes her Save against Fatigue.*

**Ref:** So that leaves 2 Damage after Armour.

**Tal:** Could I use *Deny* again?

**Ref:** No, it's once per Attack.

**Tal:** Right, got it.

**Ref:** So you've got 2 Damage coming in against 2GD, leaving you at exactly 0GD. That means a Scar. I roll on the Scar table with the die that caused Damage and get Distress, so I guess a spear just narrowly missed you, a few inches and you'd be missing an eye! Lose *(rolls d6)* 2 SPI.

**Tal:** Lucky escape I guess.

**Ref:** Moss, you're on 1GD and 6 VIG, right?

**Moss:** Yeah. I guess I'll *Deny* the 8.

*Moss removes the 8, leaving the remaining 7. He also fails his Save against Fatigue.*

**Ref:** Oof, so 4 Damage means 1 to your GD and 3 off your VIG. As you've lost half of your VIG in one go that's a Mortal Wound. Moss is overwhelmed by the Warband, kicked to the ground, an axe buried in his gut. He'll die if left untended, and I wouldn't expect mercy from these raiders. What's the plan?

## **THOUGHTS**

Keeping your Knight alive involves managing a few different resources. Armour and Guard are the first lines of defence, Vigour a more precious resource, and Feats a further tool for survival.

The Referee has to balance keeping the players aware of these while also indulging their senses in the description of the actual battle. Too much focus on numbers and resources and it becomes just a dice game. Too little and you risk the players not being able to make informed choices on how to proceed with the fight.

Ref strikes a decent balance here, but as I'm writing this for an example of play, there's perhaps more explicit explanation of the numbers than I would expect at the table.

As a general procedure I describe what the attacker is doing, roll their dice out in the open, give a chance for the Knights to use *Deny* or other Feats to modify those dice, and then tell the player how much Damage they've taken.

The player can then report back whether the Attack caused a Wound (VIG loss) or Mortal Wound (half of current VIG lost), and I can describe the Attack and its impact accordingly, shifting the focus back to what's actually happening to the characters.

As players get more experienced they'll feel more confident weighing up their options when faced with Damage. The situation faced by Moss here is a good example, and I suspect he slightly underestimated the danger he was in.

I'm not optimistic about his chances in this situation. Perhaps a chance to consider whether surrender is Knightly.

## Dynamic Combat

## **PLAY**

*Tal and Moss are launching an attack against 3 Scholar-Knights of the Order, vengeance for their attacks on the Realm.*

**Ref:** So you're charging in full-pelt?

**Moss:** Yeah, should we focus on one of them?

**Tal:** Okay, I'll send my raven out to Attack another.

*They roll their attacks, wounding the Scholar-Knight and using a Gambit to dismount another. The Order fight back, doing some Damage but no wounds yet.*

**Ref:** Okay, the Scholar-Knights bark orders at each other. It's not clear who's in charge. Still, the two on horseback dismount and form a close formation with the other, pulling their shields up into a shieldwall.

**Tal:** Right. They were already hard to Damage, I feel like we shouldn't just dive straight in.

**Moss:** Yeah you're right. Is there a way we can break up their formation?

**Tal:** That one we spoke to before was particularly proud of their horse, right? How about if we try to spook the horses away, they might break away to stop us.

**Moss:** Sure, let's try it.

**Ref:** So what are you doing exactly?

**Tal:** I don't want to hurt the horses, but I'll give them a whack with the flat side of my hammer, scream at them I guess. Shoo!

**Ref:** Okay I guess the horses will break away if you do that, but let's see if the Scholar-Knights break their formation.

*Ref fails a SPI Save for the Scholar-Knights, so describes one of them running for the horses, breaking the shieldwall.*

**Moss:** Great, I'll Attack the Knight we damaged last turn now that the shieldwall's broken. Actually, I'll use *Smite* to make sure we put them down.

## **THOUGHTS**

Dynamic combat is the idea that a fight should change with each passing round, rather than being a war of attrition. This doesn't have to apply to every combat, some are simple and end too quickly to have much of an arc, but it's especially useful to consider for longer, more significant fights.

Here we see just two rounds of combat, but there's already a narrative forming. Round 1 is the charge, round 2 is the shieldwall followed by breaking it up, and on round 3 Ref could introduce a new factor such as an environmental change or new enemy tactic.

Even just having the enemy show a changing attitude to the fight can work, showing how they're feeling about their survival chances.

A missed opportunity here is that we don't see Ref describe the location of the Attack. For all we know it's happening in a generic, featureless field. While the players were creative enough to use the dismounted enemies' steeds against them, this creativity could have been encouraged through including other tactical hooks on the battlefield. These can be mundane, such as describing especially thick woodland, boggy ground, or a nearby waterfall. For more unusual features rolling a prompt can be helpful. This could see the combat happening amidst a roaring fire, in a dim, rat-infested cave, or among choking vines hanging from the rafters of an abandoned barn.

It's great if these environments carry mechanical weight, or offer tactical opportunities, but sometimes just the change of flavour is enough to create interest.

Another good element to introduce is a time limit. Perhaps they had word that the Scholar-Knights were meeting with more of their Order, so reinforcements were expected in an uncertain number of rounds.

## Mass Combat

## **PLAY**

*The Company lead an army besieging a small fortress. They have four Warbands: 2 men-atarms, 1 archers, and 1 cavalry with javelins. They also have 2 stone throwers.*

**Ref:** It's early morning and you're facing off against the fortress. You can see hurried movement on the ramparts.

**Moss:** Well I guess we ruined the element of surprise when we let those scouts get away.

**Ref:** Yeah, in fact you see the main gate swing open, 2 Warbands emerging. Looks like a band of archers and a horde of aggressive-looking fighters, carrying an axe or blade in each hand. Remember you were told to expect the enemy's mercenaries to arrive some time this morning. Actually…

*Ref roughly sketches out the battlefield, noting a bog and a small forest.*

**Ref:** Okay so… wait, one minute.

*Ref tears up some small paper rectangles and uses them to show the locations of each Warband, coloured dice showing the Knights.*

**Ref:** Right, what's the plan?

**Tal:** I mean we could just sit back and use the stone thrower to break down the gate.

**Moss:** Remember the mercenaries? We heard they might have heavy cavalry, which would be tough to deal with. I think we need to be more decisive.

**Tal:** Well we outnumber the enemy right now. I think send the cavalry to deal with the archers and everybody else piles into that other Warband (*Tal pushes some of the paper Warbands around on the map*).

**Moss:** Okay, let's do it.

**Ref:** Right, so as you advance on the enemy your archers exchange fire with each other.

*Ref rolls an Attack for the enemy archers, Moss for the allied archers.*

**Ref:** The enemy get the better of the exchange, your archers crying out as they take casualties, but holding steady for now.

## **THOUGHTS**

Mass combat can be handled similarly to personal combat, but with Warbands as the primary unit, rather than individuals.

Much of the guidance I'd give here is similar to that of the Dynamic Combat entry, but it can be difficult to remember when faced with the concept of a full-on battle with hundreds of soldiers. Even though the scale is larger, the same principles apply. Here we see a battle with a built-in time limit, the impending arrival of enemy mercenaries. As well as this, Ref makes sure to describe what the players can see, from the bustling defenders on the ramparts to the lay of the land in front of them.

This might sound obvious, but this scale-shift can sometimes intimidate Referees, who find themselves trying to keep things as simple as possible to the detriment of the actual game. There's always a risk that things deteriorate into a numbers game without adequate description of the present situation.

Drawing out a map, like Ref does here, isn't part of the rules, but it can be useful when dealing with larger battles involving multiple Warband types, even if it's just keeping track of who's fighting whom.

Ref places a forest and a bog on the battlefield, but the combat system doesn't explicitly have rules for how Warbands behave in different terrain types. This is one of those "it doesn't matter until it matters" situations. Perhaps the players could lay an ambush in the woods, or set up behind the bog to dampen an incoming heavy cavalry charge. These things aren't detailed in the rules, but they provide vital leverage for both players and Referee to perform certain actions that would otherwise be implausible.

I'd like to see Ref asking the players where the Knights themselves are. Are they leading specific Warbands, or hanging back on their own? In a large battle like this, especially when you introduce a map and pieces, it's easy to lose track of the personal experience of the Knights.

## Advancing Time

## **PLAY**

**Tal:** Did we say about doing a time skip?

**Ref:** Oh yeah, that was the plan. We said we'd move onto the next Season. Are you happy with that?

**Moss:** Hm. Yeah. We have some loose threads but it'd be fun to move things along.

**Tal:** Yeah let's do it.

**Ref:** Right, so first of all restore your Virtues and next game Winter will arrive. What are you both focusing on before then?

*Ref shows them both the list of pursuits.*

**Tal:** "Service" means I can make a small improvement to the Realm. I'll take that.

**Ref:** Sure, what are you actually doing?

**Tal:** Could I spend some time with those hunters we met, using my raven to help them find some new hunting grounds?

**Ref:** Yeah that sounds good. Maybe it goes further and they set up a proper outpost. We'll mark it as a Dwelling on the map.

**Moss:** Can I do "Courtesy"? Perhaps not in this horrible swamp.

**Ref:** No it's fine, we assume you both travel about a bit and then reconvene next time.

**Moss:** Great, well my rank is Knight-Gallant now that I have 3 Glory, so could I use this favour to actually get a place in Court?

**Ref:** Sounds reasonable! We'll come back to that at the start of the next game. Okay, we're done!

## **THOUGHTS**

Timekeeping can be difficult enough with an RPG session, and the end of my sessions often feel rushed, hurrying to get to some sort of suitable conclusion.

With *Mythic Bastionland* it's worth "finishing" the session with sufficient time to discuss Season or Age changes. In this case it sounds like Ref is perhaps rushing before they miss their last bus home.

Although moving to the next Season was agreed upon beforehand, we see a moment of hesitancy from Ref, offering the players the chance to change their minds. I suspect Ref forgot that this was the plan right until this moment where Tal reminded them.

Luckily the players are both in agreement, but I'd encourage Ref to stick to the original plan here and move ahead with the time skip. It can be tempting for players to want to continue the moment-to-moment story of their characters, picking up the next session right where they left off, but I think the progress of time makes for a better campaign in the long term.

When choosing their pursuit between seasons I like that Ref pushes Tal to describe what she's actually doing, rather than just picking her choice from a list. It's also a nice little reward to have this action create a new Dwelling on the map for the players to make use of in future.

![](_page_192_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Moss:** We heard there's a brilliant blacksmith in this castle, right? How about we try to get some better gear?

**Ref:** Sure, down in the tunnels beneath the castle you follow the clangs and heat of the forge. Sure enough you find a blacksmith toiling, the walls lined with an array of arms.

**Tal:** We said about getting bows, is there a bow on the wall?

**Ref:** So arms are generally split into Common, Uncommon, and Rare.

*Ref opens the book for the players and gestures over the list.*

**Ref:** Since this guy is a proper weaponsmith I reckon they've got plenty of Common stockpiled, and some Uncommon and Rare tucked away in storage or made to order.

**Tal:** Wait how much money do we have?

**Ref:** You have a bit, but big bags of money are for rich merchants. You're Knights! You need three things to make a trade: somebody who can supply the thing, raw materials if needed, and something to give in return.

**Moss:** Okay, let's see what their deal is first.

*The group play out a conversation with the blacksmith, who seems fiercely loyal to the Lady of the Castle.*

**Tal:** Okay, well we're here to help the Lady, so could we take a couple of bows?

**Moss:** Wait, I also want a proper sword.

**Ref:** The smith happily pulls some bows off the wall and hands them to you, a quiver of arrows each.

**Tal:** Actually why would a blacksmith have bows? Are they metal bows?

**Ref:** I guess this is a general weapon store. When you ask about the swords he seems less open. "I'll have to speak to the Lady about that, I'm sure you understand."

**Moss:** Okay, all the more important we make a good impression.

## **THOUGHTS**

Playing a game without tracking of currency or abstract wealth ratings is an adjustment for most players. The intent is to get players into more of a feudal mindset, where longstanding exchanges of service, labour, protection, and goods make up the majority of trade. Aside from any sense of immersion, this approach encourages players to consider the place of the characters in the world and the network of relationships between nonplayer characters.

Here we see that in a well-worn scene of RPGs: shopping for weapons.

What does the blacksmith want? Ref thinks they're content. Working for the Lady gives them a relatively secure life in the castle. When Knights arrive to help the Lady it seems fitting that the blacksmith would help up to a certain point, but still ultimately need the Lady's approval to give out Rare items like swords. The players could have tried to bribe him, but does this smith really need money? I suspect he wouldn't be so easily tempted. Instead, as the players learn more about this character, his place in the castle's society, and his relationship with the Lady, they might be able to pull his strings a bit more effectively.

Later, Tal points out that maybe the bows should be located elsewhere, as they're made from wood, not metal. It's pretty common for players to question apparent errors like this, and it shouldn't be considered malicious.

Instead of immediately hitting undo, consider why the seemingly inconsistent element could be true. Here it's obvious, but you can create some interesting situations by throwing such queries back at the players.

"Yeah, that is weird, right? Why do you think that could be? Do you want to ask somebody about it or investigate?"

Sometimes they'll shrug it off, sometimes it'll set them on a tangent, but wherever possible I like to keep to my word as a Referee, which means we're sometimes discovering and justifying the details of the world together.

![](_page_193_Picture_0.jpeg)

*The Knights are trapped in a besieged citadel, the attackers almost through the main gate.*

**Tal:** I knew this was a trap when we had to hand our weapons over on arrival.

**Moss:** But this place must have weapons somewhere. Where did the guards get their weapons from?

**Ref:** Some guards stuck around, not part of the plot against you. They direct you to an arms store at the base of the citadel. There's basically any common weapon you could want. Some piecemeal armour too, but you still have your own armour at least.

**Tal:** What looks most dangerous?

**Ref:** So there are some polearms, like some halberds and… fauchards? You know, blades and spikes on poles. They look the most effective, but they're also long, so won't be great in an enclosed environment.

**Tal:** Yeah and I guess we're going to be fighting on that big spiral stair at some point.

**Moss:** Okay, something one-handed, so I can use my shield. Like a solid mace or axe?

**Tal:** Hey remember those bone-creatures were tough to kill with sharp weapons? Let's get a mace and shield each. Actually, I'll take a mace and another weapon. Is there something I could wield in my other hand?

**Ref:** Sure, you grab a hefty mace and a light mace that you can wield together effectively.

**Moss:** Wait, are there any javelins here? Or spears that we could throw if needed?

**Ref:** Erm, hang on.

*Ref makes a Luck Roll and gets 4, an okay result for the players.*

**Ref:** So there are some shortspears. Not designed for throwing but they'll work okay. Let's say you can throw them for d6 like javelins, but rolls of 6 are discarded.

**Moss:** Rubbish. Well better than throwing rocks I guess.

## **THOUGHTS**

In *Mythic Bastionland* weapons should matter, but not *too much.* I wanted players to feel like they had an interesting choice of weapons, but I didn't want them to spend too much time crunching numbers.

Breaking the weapons into broad categories means that the choice between a polearm or a shortsword matters, but *specific* polearms generally behave in the same way.

Specialist weapons are a special case if you want a weapon for a niche situation.

Here the players start by looking for the "best" weapon, which Ref reasonably interprets as "the weapon with the biggest Attack die", but their current situation of defending a tower leads them to consider the environment they're likely to be fighting in.

Better yet, they remember that blunt weapons would be especially useful against their expected enemy. There's no "blunt" weapon type listed, so the game relies on the group using common sense. An advantage of this approach is that mechanically identical weapons can become mechanically distinct if the right situation arises.

When looking for a particular type of weapon, Ref falls back on the ever-useful Luck Roll, a mixed result prompting them to reveal a weapon that *almost* does what they want. Here Ref throws together a ruling out of nowhere, saying that throwing the spears will mean rolls of 6 are discarded, making them less effective than javelins.

They could have gone in other directions with this. Perhaps they're ineffective beyond close range; perhaps they gain the slow rule when thrown; or perhaps they're bulky enough that you can only carry a couple.

It's inevitable that a Referee will need to make rulings like this on the fly, and I think this solution is fine. I like the idea that players might roll a 6 and blame the spears, wishing they had proper javelins instead.

![](_page_194_Picture_0.jpeg)

*Tal has been spotted sneaking into a tower. Her SPI has already been depleted on the journey, and now her Guard has been depleted by a volley of arrows. Moss ducks out of sight but Tal runs for the tower.*

*The sentries roll high and Tal has no choice but to take the Damage reducing her VIG to 0, meaning she is Slain.*

**Ref:** Oh, wow. One of the arrows flies straight into Tal's throat… she falls to the ground, a pool of blood forming. She's slain.

**Moss:** What!?

**Tal:** Argh, I knew that was a dumb thing to do. Is there anything else I can do?

**Ref:** I mean you're out of Guard, Spirit, and Vigour, so I think that's it for Tal.

*Tal sighs and folds up the character sheet.*

**Ref:** Well we have less than an hour left tonight, so I'd recommend we sort your new character at the start of the next session, or you can do it at home. You can make a brand new Knight or you could take on a successor. You had that Squire who was injured, maybe they could get Knighted for themselves.

**Tal:** Yeah. Urgh, I should have ran away.

**Moss:** Hey we've both been taking risks, this could have happened to me. Can I recover the body? Tal deserves a proper funeral after all.

**Ref:** Oh definitely, we'll get to that. In the meantime I'll get Tal a character for now. Moss, what's your plan after recovering Tal?

**Moss:** Well I need to get to safety for the night. Oh, and I look for Tal's raven!

**Ref:** Sure. Tal, you okay?

**Tal:** Yeah, I guess I was just getting attached to this character.

*Ref sets up Tal with a character for the rest of the session, using a prompt to get a new character to meet Moss as quickly as possible. Between sessions Tal rolls a new Knight to join the company, the Riddle Knight.*

## **THOUGHTS**

Death can be a shocking presence, but I believe that it's an important element to have in a game based around Knights.

It's usually considered a sort of "fail state" of the game, and *Mythic Bastionland* embraces the more unpredictable side of death instead of great sacrifices scripted ahead of time. If your Guard, Spirit, and Vigour are all getting low then it's advisable to do everything you can to avoid taking further Damage.

Although it's a failure of that character, who would surely rather be alive, it's not a failure of the ongoing story of the game. All Knights die in the end. This is why they seek successors, heirs, Squires.

Many Referees would be tempted to find a way to keep Tal alive. Dying to the arrow of a nameless sentry feels like an ignoble end for a protagonist, but we can see that Tal had opportunities to avoid this. As a Referee, if in doubt, make sure players understand this risk when they take such an action.

Of course, it still feels bad. The player might feel embarrassed that they let it happen, or sad that they won't get to continue using their character. It's perfectly fine to take a moment to acknowledge these feelings, and make sure that the player doesn't feel the death was somehow unfair or unwarranted. Here I prefer an impartial approach. If the rules say they're slain, then they're slain.

The Referee didn't kill Tal, the arrows did.

Ref does the right thing here by getting Tal right back into the game with a new character, in this case a temporary one. Elevating an existing NPC to become Tal's new character would be great, but sometimes none of the existing characters fit, so it makes sense to just introduce a new Knight.

In most cases I'd start the new Knight as a Young Knight-Errant, but if the Company is well-established then it might make sense to start them with some Glory.

195

![](_page_195_Picture_0.jpeg)

*After her character died last session, Tal has created a new character, the Riddle Knight. The Company are already worn down, having suffered CLA loss. They're hunting a rogue Knight who's been harassing travellers.*

**Ref:** So this is the hill where you heard the rogue Knight was last spotted. What's the plan from here?

**Tal:** How about we search for tracks. I can roll CLA for that, right?

**Ref:** Erm… Hang on.

*Ref looks at the Action Procedure and asks a few clarifying questions to Tal.*

**Ref:** So the risk is that by scouring around these woods looking for tracks you might attract some unwanted attention.

**Moss:** Wait, if we're just searching for something quickly could I use Vigour instead? That's for like… athletic stuff, right?

**Ref:** Hm, no, I think that doesn't work here. Clarity is sharp senses and quick thinking, which is what's being used here.

**Tal:** Urgh, we've both got super low Clarity at the minute. I wish I'd thought of this before we came all the way out here.

**Ref:** Well there's always another way. Instead of scouring for tracks you could try to find somebody to talk to, see if they've encountered the rogue Knight.

**Tal:** Oh, and if we get "guidance from a Seer" then we recover our Clarity, right? I know it's quite far, but we could travel over to this Sanctum *(points to the map)* where we know there's a Seer living.

**Moss:** Works for me, we might get some other good info while we're there.

**Ref:** Great, so which way are you travelling?

## **THOUGHTS**

With just three Virtues to choose from, it's usually clear which Virtue should be used for a Save, or damaged by a particular harmful effect. Ref is pretty confident that Clarity is the Virtue to use for covertly tracking an enemy, and I'd agree with them here.

In those cases where it's not so clear I tend to err on the side of giving the players the final say, but I'd hope that these instances are rare. If they start occurring frequently then I'd take a moment to talk through the Virtues with the players, making sure everybody understands what each of them represents for their character.

In this example we see that having low scores in a Virtue can create some interesting moments, here driving the players to seek out a Seer in the hope of both recovering their Clarity and getting the information they were looking for.

If there wasn't a Seer nearby then Ref could still have suggested some alternative directions for them to take, and speaking with the locals is usually a good direction to nudge players toward.

If the players are desperate to restore a Virtue, and the most obvious means of doing so is too far away, then remind them that Remedies exist, suggesting where they might be found. Although they represent uncommon goods, a Holding will usually at least be able to point them in the right direction. For Stimulant, which is used to restore Clarity, perhaps they'd be directed toward a local herbalist or alchemist in service of the ruler, remembering that these things are never given away for free.

If all else fails, remember that moving to a new Season or Age restores all Virtues, so sometimes an impromptu time skip can be the best way to move things forward.

![](_page_196_Picture_0.jpeg)

*The Company are part-way through a journey between two distant Holdings. Ref points to their current Hex location on the map.*

**Ref:** Okay, you wake up and clear away the camp. It's…

*Ref makes a few rolls on the Nature Spark Tables for Sky and Weather.*

**Ref:** There's a pale haze in the air, not enough to hinder your view, but gives a slight fuzz to the forested mountains in the distance. There's a dull humidity, no breeze at all, a contrast to yesterday's bitter storm!

**Moss:** Yeah, sounds better to me.

**Tal:** So we keep going, right?

*Tal gestures to their final destination on the map, then to the next Hex in that direction.*

**Tal:** Head over there, I think. Wait, can we see anything around us?

**Ref:** Sure, you camped on a decent vantage point, so you got a good look at your surroundings. You can see this Hex is mostly rolling hills, a few patchy forests.

*Ref points to the Hex Tal had indicated as their next destination.*

**Ref:** In that direction it looks much the same, no sign of any real points of interest.

*On their own map, Ref sees that a different adjacent Hex has a Monument landmark. In their notes this is an "Eternal Hearth".*

**Ref:** Over to the West you can see there's some sort of structure in amongst the hills, a little smoke rising from it.

**Moss:** Ah… we could go and get some proper rest over there. It's out of our way, though.

**Tal:** Yeah… we're in good condition, though. Maybe let's just mark it on our map for now and check it out another time.

**Moss:** Okay, works for me.

## **THOUGHTS**

Focusing on long distance travel calls for a "zoomed out" approach that can be daunting in comparison to the more moment-bymoment play of exploration and combat.

Here I like that Ref takes a moment to set the scene beyond just the paper map in front of them. Even seemingly inconsequential weather and sky descriptions help to paint the scene of the Knights travelling across great distances and significant passages of time. They also give sensory grounding to the relatively abstract Hex map.

The Spark Tables are a great source for this, and I always keep them to hand when running the game.

Ref also ensures the players have the information needed to make interesting choices. In particular, telling them that they can see *something* in a neighbouring Hex, but not outright stating what it is. Now they face a choice between continuing to their destination or taking a detour to a potentially useful location.

There's also a good amount of generosity on display here. Ref states that there's a haze in the air, but not enough to obscure the Knights' view. They also assume that the Company set up camp on a vantage point, allowing them to easily survey their surroundings. I'd always lean in this direction, but I absolutely wouldn't hesitate to make the Knights' lives difficult when the dice prompt it.

For example, if the weather roll was "Solid Fog" then I think it's appropriate to say that the Knights can't see into their neighbouring hexes, perhaps even travelling blind unless they have a way to maintain their course.

## Hospitality **THOUGHTS**

## **PLAY**

*The Company encounter an Omen of the Pack, a shepherd having lost his flock to his own dogs. The Knights do their best to help, but the shepherd is heartbroken.*

**Moss:** Wait, where does this shepherd live? We're nowhere near a Holding or Dwelling.

**Ref:** Do you want to ask him?

**Moss:** Yeah, okay.

**Ref:** He gestures in the direction of his home, a simple hut hidden away within this Hex. He also has a second hut in the neighbouring Hex, where he sometimes moves his flock.

**Tal:** We should rest up here before we start our journey back to the Seat of Power.

**Ref:** Yeah, proper hospitality restores your VIG, remember? You've both got some wounds that would benefit from it.

**Moss:** Okay, I ask the shepherd if he can provide a warm place to sleep for tonight.

**Ref:** Well, he's despairing about his flock being torn apart by his own dogs, so I wouldn't expect too much of a warm welcome. He offers you a place for the night, as is the custom, but you get the sense he'd rather you weren't there.

*Ref pauses for a moment.*

**Ref:** Actually, one of you can give me a SPI Save to see what his response is like.

*Tal rolls an 18, failing the Save.*

**Ref:** Yeah, he takes you in and cooks you some food, rolls out some simple bedding, but the conversation is clearly focused on when you're both going to leave tomorrow.

**Moss:** Rude.

**Tal:** To be fair, he's got bigger problems to deal with right now. Okay, let's work out what we're doing the next morning.

**Ref:** Sure, and you can both restore VIG.

Knights can expect hospitality from most of the people they encounter on their travels, but this can still create some interesting conflicts. Commonly these are based around how much the Company are willing to upset

their host by outstaying their welcome, or whether the host is bold enough to ask for

something in return.

This section of play starts with a good example of how the Realm can be moulded by both the actions of the Knights and the Myths as they unfold. In an area with no mention of inhabitants, a Myth describes a shepherd. This suggests that the shepherd must have a home nearby, even if it was not previously noted on the map, and so it becomes reality.

I'd encourage Ref to note this down on the map as a new Dwelling.

Of course, if the Company were in a Hex utterly unsuitable for a shepherd to live in, then the Referee might find a reason for them to be so far from home. Perhaps they're in the middle of a long journey or pilgrimage.

Ref also indulges in asking for a Spirit Save to gauge the shepherd's reaction to the Knights' request for hospitality. This feels like a low stakes roll, as even with a failure the shepherd allows the Knights to stay for the night.

Normally I look to the mantra of "no risk, no roll" but I still think there's a place for Saves like this in the quieter moments of play. For example, if Tal had passed the Save then perhaps the shepherd might encourage them to stay even longer, becoming reliant upon the Knights for a feeling of security after their ordeal.

![](_page_198_Picture_0.jpeg)

*The Company is in a tower, overlooking the surrounding Hexes. Ref gestures to each Hex as they describe the terrain in broad terms.*

**Ref:** The forest continues all across the west. The south looks more marshy, and there are rough hills to the east.

*On their copy of the map, Ref notices there's a Landmark in a neighbouring Hex, a Ruin. They rolled a prompt for this as part of their prep, noting that it relates to the Blade, a Myth not currently active in the Realm. The prompt for the Ruin was "crumbled bridge".*

**Ref:** You can spot a bridge in the distance out in this direction, but you can't see the details from this far away.

*The players decide to head toward the bridge, arriving in the next Phase of the day.*

**Ref:** Okay, so the bridge spans a mostly dried up stream and has collapsed, the centre now a heap of rubble.

*Ref turns to the Blade myth to look for a hint to place here. They decide to use "Ilglamvent", one of the names given for the Blade.*

**Ref:** In amongst the rubble you can see a large block. There's something carved on it, covered in red moss.

**Tal:** I'll carefully scrape it off with my dagger, trying to see the carving.

**Ref:** It's faint but you can just make out the shape of a sword, the word "Ilglamvent" written down the length of its blade.

**Tal:** Huh.

**Moss:** I'll look through the rubble. Maybe there's a sword down here?

**Ref:** Yeah you dig through but there doesn't seem to be anything of note.

**Moss:** Right. Hm.

**Ref:** So where next?

## **THOUGHTS**

Where Myths and Holdings generally act as the major features within the Realm, Landmarks tend to have a more understated place in the game.

Ruins in particular can feel almost out of place, offering a glimpse at a Myth that won't actually be used in the Realm as it stands. The intent is to hint at a wider and older world, and as we see here it can create moments that border on anticlimactic.

I don't think this is something to be feared. These moments of relative calm can be a welcome change of tempo. I like that Ref allows the moment to play out before giving the players a gentle nudge to move on, asking them where they want to go next.

Ref did just about enough preparation here, rolling the Ruin's Myth ahead of time and choosing a prompt for its general description. They could have gone further and worked out how the bridge tied in to the Blade, but they were able to improvise this just fine.

If they found themselves stuck, unable to draw a connection between the Ruin and its Myth, then I'd encourage them to take a more relaxed approach. Maybe for now this bridge is just a bridge, no Myth connection at all. It still acts as a point of interest, a literal landmark to help with navigation.

They could also place a person near to the Ruin, giving them knowledge of the related Myth. Perhaps a wandering pilgrim is seeking the Blade, but nobody in this Realm has heard of it. Anything that helps the world feel large or old would work.

## Folklore

## **PLAY**

*The Company are staying in the Holding of a friendly ruler. After dinner they are left to their own devices for a while. They have already encountered one Omen of the Child.*

**Ref:** Okay, what are you both doing?

**Tal:** The ruler here seems friendly enough, but I'll see if anybody else looks keen to talk.

**Moss:** I'll ask around to see what people know about the Child.

**Ref:** Okay, Tal, as you're moving around the hall a Knight strides over. You've not met them before, they're…

*Ref rolls on some Spark Tables to get an idea of their appearance.*

**Ref:** He looks sort of soft-bodied for a Knight, a tattered cloak over his patchwork mail. He speaks in a whispered tone.

*Ref rolls a random Myth of the Realm for this Knight to know about, getting the Shadow.*

**Ref:** "Greetings, Knight. Have you come from the north?"

**Tal:** Erm… *(she checks the map)* no, we've ridden in from the east.

**Ref:** "Well, take my word for it, if you're heading north then don't look too closely into the shadows. A sorrowful presence lurks there. My brother-in-arms has already been taken by its melancholy."

**Tal:** Is this something to do with the Child?

**Ref:** He doesn't seem to know anything about the Child. He explains that he's recently arrived in the Realm. He also describes the location of a Monument he passed on the way, the mausoleum of a nameless Knight.

*Ref points to the Monument's location on the map, a few Hexes north of the Holding.*

**Tal:** Great, that's useful.

**Moss:** Yeah, do I have any luck?

## **THOUGHTS**

Non-player characters can be useful in different ways. They can offer hospitality, equipment, remedies, military aid, new positions in a Council, or even a Holding to rule. Whoever they are, most people are also able to offer the resource of knowledge, as detailed in the Folklore section of the rules.

We can see the importance of this here, with Moss actively seeking information and Tal being more passive. I like that Ref gives Tal this useful information even though she didn't explicitly ask for it. When it comes to Myths I like to ensure they're worked into the conversations happening all across the Realm, even if the character is a new arrival.

Ref gives some very vague knowledge of the Shadow here. They could have had the Knight outright explain an encounter with the Shadow, or one of its Omens, but the key is that they wouldn't know the inner workings of the Myth. That level of knowledge is restricted to Seers, and is the basis for their powerful position within the society of the Realm.

Ref could have gone further here, and had Tal meet the actual Knight described in the Myth. One Omen describes a sorrowful Knight, lashing out at passers-by, and they could have presented this character to the Company, appearing before their sad fate.

They could go in another direction, replacing the Knight described in the Shadow's Omen with this new Knight who Tal has just met.

Instead, Ref takes the more straightforward option of having the Knight who Tal meets simply having a connection to the Knight that will appear in a later Omen. Still effective, but it's always good to consider other options.

![](_page_200_Picture_0.jpeg)

*The Company are travelling through a barren tundra during winter, facing dire weather at every turn. Ref makes a Wilderness Roll and gets a 1, rolling for a random Myth from elsewhere in the Realm. They roll the Forest, of which the Company have already encountered the first five Omens. This means they'll encounter the sixth and final Omen.*

**Ref:** Okay… hm…

*Ref fumbles slightly, as the previous omens had all been encountered in areas with plenty of trees, an easy fit for the Forest.*

**Ref:** A bitter mist rolls over the tundra again, chilling your faces. Through the mist you can see shapes. It looks like a forest.

**Moss:** I thought this whole area was a sort of frozen wasteland?

**Ref:** Yeah, it was.

**Tal:** Oh, I bet this is something to do with the Forest, right?

**Moss:** Yeah, shall we go in?

**Tal:** I think we should! We're meant to be "seeking the Myths" after all.

**Moss:** Okay, let's carefully go in.

**Ref:** As you enter the mist begins to clear. The air even feels warmer. Looking around, you feel like you're in the middle of a deep forest, despite having only walked a few paces into the trees.

**Moss:** At least it's warm.

**Ref:** A towering figure stands boldly between the trees. Their body is thick, writhing wood, knotted and gnarled. Their hands are like great clawed roots. The imposing creature looms over you. What do you do?

## **THOUGHTS**

Remember that Myths operate under their own rules, and they don't need to follow the usual laws of reality.

This means situations like this one, where a Myth's Omen feels an odd fit for the current situation, can easily be woven into the ongoing story.

It helps that, in general, the players *want* to find Omens and resolve Myths, as this is the main way that they gain Glory. Besides, the nature of Omens is that they're all going to happen eventually, so being caught off-guard by one isn't a huge problem.

I like that Ref doesn't try to contradict their previous description of the area. The wasteland was just as frozen and inhospitable as they had previously described, and now it's miraculously transformed into a thick forest.

One of the reasons that Knights tend not to have magical-feeling abilities is that I want the world to feel more magical than the people within it.

You'll be exploring a mystical land, and while you'll sometimes benefit or suffer at the hands of its magic, you'll never quite understand or control it yourself.

This is perfect for handling these moments, but should never be done at the cost of the previously established fiction of the game.

When they enter the woods, Ref jumps straight into the encounter with the Fearmonger in their true form. This is fine, but there was also an opportunity to have the players explore this strange place a little before the Fearmonger shows themselves. It would give a little more weight to the fact that the Forest manifested so suddenly, allowing the players to take that in for a moment before thrusting them into a highstakes situation.

## Mapping a Realm **PLAY THOUGHTS**

PLAY

*Ref is preparing a new Realm for the Company to explore. They're using a piece of hex mapping software and following the guidance in the Creating a Realm section.*

*They want this Realm to be an isolated island, so instead of the recommended 12x12 grid they use a 6x6 grid. They figure this will work if they just divide any recommended quantities by four, as there are only a quarter of the normal amount of Hexes.*

*They decide not to use the Spark Tables to generate the terrain types, as they already have some ideas for the map. They draw a cluster of mountains in the centre of the island, a swamp covering the western half, and a scattering of forests and hills on the eastern half. They draw a few Barriers where it feels appropriate.*

*They want the island to be caught in a dispute between its two Holdings, both claiming to be the Seat of Power. They place the Holdings on opposite sides of the island.*

*Two Myths instead of the usual six feels about right for this smaller Realm, so they place them at far points of the island. They decide that a single Landmark of each type also feels right, scattering them around. They decide to add an extra Hazard and an extra Curse, just to make the island feel more hostile.*

*The island looks pretty good, but Ref doesn't have a clear idea of the two conflicting rulers. They head to the Spark Tables section of the book and roll on some of the "People" tables.*

*The first set of results gives a hard appearance, elegant dress, soothing tone, blunt manner. Some juxtapositions there. Perhaps a Knight hardened by a life of conflict, now doing their best to be a diplomatic ruler.*

*The second gives a melancholic demeanour, interest in Myths, and "distant mentor" as their relationship to the other ruler. Maybe this ruler is actually a Seer. Perhaps a former Seer, having lost their sight, now struggling with ruling a Holding.*

The procedure for creating a Realm is a useful starting point for any game, but sooner or later a Referee is going to want to break some of those rules. This is absolutely encouraged, and here we see Ref creating a Realm that still draws on the tools and guidance available, but also allows them to indulge in their own creativity.

A smaller Realm can be a fun change from the larger maps that the standard procedure creates. I've also had success with a Realm made up of a large ocean dotted with tiny islands, or a much wilder Realm with just a single Holding and more hostile Landmarks.

We see that Ref starts off discarding most of the tools, creating the parts of the Realm for which they already have a clear vision. When they reach an area that they don't already have ideas for, the Spark Tables give just enough to get their imagination flowing, prompting some unexpected results.

This is a balance that every Referee will find for themselves.

If they rely purely on the procedures and tables in the book then they're missing an opportunity to inject their own ideas into their world.

If they use only their own ideas then they may find themselves sticking too closely to what they already know.

Taking an unexpected result of a Spark Table, like those seen in this example, and using your own imagination to explain them allows you to create a Realm in your own style, while still pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone.

This is shown in Ref's idea of a former Seer now being a ruler. Nothing from the Spark Table explicitly mentioned this, but it gave Ref just enough of a nudge to create the idea for themselves.

## Between Ages

## **PLAY**

*Ref and the players are sitting down for their first session in a while.*

**Ref:** Okay, so I thought rather than trying to pick up where we left off we could move into a new Age. This is generally twenty years or so, advancing you both from being Young Knights to being Mature, in your prime!

**Moss:** Oh right, we might improve our Virtues here, I think.

**Ref:** Yeah, you can reroll each of your Virtues on d12+d6, keeping the new result only if it's higher than your current score.

*The players both do this, improving some of their Virtues.*

**Moss:** Hey, my Vigour went from 6 to 18!

**Tal:** What!? That can't be right.

**Ref:** Remember, this has been decades since we last saw the characters. Moss, think of what might have happened to cause you to improve your Vigour so much.

**Moss:** Well it was pretty bad before. I guess I started out kind of soft and have been hardened by all these years as a Knight.

**Ref:** Yeah makes sense. Now you also both choose a Pursuit.

*Ref shows them the Pursuits list and each player chooses one.*

**Ref:** Now I did some rolls before we started to see how things have changed around the Realm, but you'll have to discover that for yourselves.

**Tal:** Wouldn't we know how things are going?

**Ref:** Right… well, I'll give you a brief overview, but let's say that you've spent the last few years away from the Realm, returning now to see what's happened.

*Ref gives them a very broad description of what's changed in the Realm, who rules each Holding, but leaves it very vague.*

**Ref:** Okay, let's work out where you start.

## **THOUGHTS**

Advancing the game to the next Age can be daunting, leaving a narrative gap of a few decades and sometimes having the characters go through dramatic changes, like we see here with Moss.

This should be embraced rather than feared, and Moss seems happy enough to justify their sudden surge in Vigour when Ref reminds them that it wasn't all that sudden in the fiction of the world.

We see there's a slight disconnect between the knowledge of the players and their characters. Ref is clearly excited for the players to go and explore the Realm, seeing what's changed, but Tal points out that the Knights would probably already know many of these things.

Saying that the Knights have been absent from the Realm is a decent fix for this, but Ref could also have the players ask the questions they want to know. Maybe even make a game of it, saying that they can each ask three questions, representing that their Knights wouldn't know of every happening in every corner of the Realm.

Giving them a surface level overview of the whole Realm might be excessive, when it's likely that they just want to know about some of the non-player characters they're invested in.

It's another good example of the power of just asking the players what they want, instead of trying to second-guess them.

![](_page_202_Picture_25.jpeg)

## Council & Court

## **PLAY**

**Ref:** Okay, Tal, now that you're the rightful ruler of Raider's Gate you'll want to assemble a Council.

*Ref outlines the positions of Steward, Marshall, Sheriff, and Envoy.*

**Tal:** Okay, Moss, are you up for being the Marshall? Getting the soldiers into shape?

**Moss:** Yeah, of course.

**Ref:** Yeah that works. Now even though you proved the previous ruler, the Chain Knight, as an enemy of the Realm, the Steward who served under him is still here. She's Medryn, very formal and professional. You can kick her out of her seat or keep her on.

**Tal:** Let's keep her on for now, but we'll keep a close eye on her. I'll go and talk to her properly a little later.

**Ref:** Well security is also part of the Sheriff's job, watching for threats inside and outside your walls. Who are you appointing there?

**Tal:** Needs to be somebody we trust.

**Moss:** I don't think I trust anybody around here anymore.

**Tal:** Okay… can we leave the seat vacant just for now while we decide?

**Ref:** We can talk about it some more, but I definitely wouldn't leave your Realm without a Sheriff unless you want to invite trouble!

**Tal:** Argh, okay. Hey, what about that guy who was guarding the tower we found?

**Moss:** Yeah, he helped us out.

**Tal:** Okay, he was over here, right?

*Tal points at a landmark a few Hexes away.*

**Tal:** Can I like… send a rider out to summon him or something?

**Ref:** Of course, you're the ruler now!

## **THOUGHTS**

Like so many other parts of the game, ruling a Holding is at its best when the players have enough information to prompt difficult decisions with impactful consequences.

Assembling the Council is a good opportunity for this. As we see here, it's a chance to introduce new characters or elevate previously encountered people into a more prominent role.

Focusing Holding management on the Council has a few beneficial effects. Firstly it keeps the spotlight on interactions with characters rather than the fine details of economics and infrastructure. You can decide that you want to collect more taxes, or change the armament of your warbands, but doing so requires going through your Steward or Marshall respectively, keeping those relationships at the forefront.

This is most effective when a ruler's Council and Court are both populated by a dynamic cast of characters. Here a Referee can create a messy web of ambitions and quarrels for the ruler to attempt to keep in order. A combination of Spark Tables and Luck Rolls can give some useful prompts for this.

If one of the Knights ends up ruling a Seat of Power, then the rulers of each Holding become an additional layer of relationships to manage on top of this.

I like to ensure that the ruler still gets a chance to go out and be a Knight, letting their Council manage things in their absence. This can be encouraged by reassuring the player that Knights are expected to delegate rule to their Steward in order to continue fulfilling their Oath. If a Knight gets too bogged down in politicking from their castle then word begins to spread that they've grown soft or renounced their Oath to "seek the Myths". That should give them a nudge toward adventure.

![](_page_204_Picture_0.jpeg)

*Tal and Moss return to Raider's Gate after a few weeks visiting a foreign Realm.*

**Ref:** Okay, so as you ride to the gate a sentry notices you and shouts an order to open up. The portcullis creaks upward, allowing you to ride into the courtyard. A horn sounds, and another sentry scrambles to quickly pull your banner up, hanging proudly above the hall.

**Tal:** Nice to see the place is still standing.

**Ref:** Sure, but let's see what's been happening while you were away. Roll a d6.

*Tal rolls 3, scoring a Dilemma. Ref rolls two Crises for Tal to choose from, getting Chaos and Doubt.*

**Ref:** Hmm… okay… As you enter the hall you're greeted by your Council, and the Steward gives you an overview. She explains that the coffers are full, the harvest looks good, but there are whispers of an uprising in the Realm, in both field and Court.

**Tal:** What for??

**Ref:** She beckons to the Sheriff who explains that these things are usually started by somebody who wants to seize the Holding for themselves. He has a few agents that he can send out to nip it in the bud, but he'll need to focus on the dissent in the Court or out in the wider domain. You'll have to investigate the other yourselves.

**Moss:** Well we know most of the people in Court, right? I think we could handle that side ourselves.

**Tal:** Yeah. I tell him to send his agents out to speak with the Vassals and I'll investigate the dissent inside these walls.

**Ref:** Great, he heads off to start work on that. How are you starting your own investigation?

**Tal:** Do we have a dungeon?

## **THOUGHTS**

Crises need to walk a fine line between creating interesting problems for the players to solve without becoming an annoyance that makes the Knights never want to leave their Holding, or reluctant to return when they do.

It's a small, unrelated detail, but here I like that Ref doesn't just cut to the Knights sitting in Court. They've been away in a distant land for weeks, so it's nice to indulge a little in the feeling of returning home.

Early on, Ref faces one of the more difficult prompts, creating a Dilemma between two Crises, in this case Chaos and Doubt.

Exactly how the choice will present itself is left to the Referee's discretion, so here their Sheriff is able to resolve one of the Crises while the other is left to be handled by the Knights personally.

The Dilemma could be presented in a less direct way. Perhaps a lowly Vassal comes to Court to challenge the ruler's authority. Allowing them to do so could spread Doubt within the Court, whereas dealing with them too harshly could cause Chaos through a popular uprising.

Improvising these in the middle of a game can be challenging, so if Ref struggled with this they might prepare the outlines of a few Dilemmas ahead of the next session, keeping them on hand for if they're needed.

Remember that any part of the game is only worthwhile if it's serving the type of game that the group wants to play. If the constant presence of Crises begins to wear the players down then mix it up. Shift the focus to some specific interpersonal drama with Court, or have a new Myth rise to prominence. The Crisis system is just one way to make rulership challenging, and Referees should feel free to experiment with other methods.

## Delving into Tomorrow

Mythic Bastionland follows on from the games *Into the Odd* and *Electric Bastionland,* which explore the world's industrial and electric eras respectively. Yet unwritten games may explore other eras and areas.

The games are built on the same rules, with key differences noted opposite. These aren't exhaustive lists, but highlight some important things to keep in mind.

It's completely viable to take characters or content from one game to another, with the following guidance:

- Use the content of the game you're playing as a guideline for conversion. If you bring a rifle from *Electric Bastionland* into the world of *Mythic Bastionland* then look at how much damage a crossbow does and boost it a little from there.
- Capture the spirit of the content or character that you're converting, rather than worrying about finding the perfect numbers. *Mythic Bastionland's* Virtues mostly line up with the Ability Scores of the other two games, but sometimes it's better to assign a value that feels right.
- Use as much of each game as you like. *Into the Odd* characters might learn the Feats from *Mythic Bastionland,* continuing to use them even when they return to that industrial setting.
- Use as little as you like. If those same *Into the Odd* characters are playing in a horror-themed scenario then perhaps the heroic Feats aren't a good fit.
- If you're feeling overwhelmed then just take the system you're most familiar with and use that for everything. You can play a game of *Into the Odd* exploring both *Electric* and *Mythic Bastionlands* without touching any of the new rules. The players will remember the worlds they explore much more than the specific set of rules that they used.

## **INTO THE ODD**

- The game that both of the others are built upon, and the simplest overall.
- It's easy to be swamped by enemies when they outnumber you.
- Arcana are powerful devices with a single useful ability.
- Characters gain Hit Protection by completing expeditions and later training an apprentice.

## **ELECTRIC BASTIONLAND**

- Multiple attackers roll and keep the single highest die, making outnumbering less deadly than in *Into the Odd.*
- Scars can occur in combat, often improving the victim's maximum Hit Protection.
- Arcana are renamed as Oddities and Willpower is replaced by Charisma.

## **MYTHIC BASTIONLAND**

- Uses Virtues in place of Ability Scores, each recovered by different methods.
- Guard is the new name for Hit Protection but functions in the same way.
- Feats and Gambits create more in-depth combat rules.
- Armour can be layered, so Armour values are generally higher.
- Because of the above, Damage is a touch higher across the board.

## **THE TRUTH OF IT ALL**

How are these worlds connected?

Do they form a linear timeline from a medieval age up to a late modern period?

Is there just one true setting, the others just stories told by its inhabitants?

Do they exist simultaneously, characters able to wander from one age to another if they know the way?

Yes.
